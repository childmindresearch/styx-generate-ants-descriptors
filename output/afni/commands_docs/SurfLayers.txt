Overview ~1~

This is a program to compute intermediate surfaces between two boundary surfaces

SurfLayers computes new surfaces for a given number of cortical divisions
at intermediate distances by simple computation of the fraction 
between the inner and outer-most surfaces (aka "equi-distant"). 
A single dividing surface would be halfway between the two surfaces.

Options ~1~

  -spec SPEC_DSET      :dataset that is the SUMA specification file
                        describing input surfaces 

  -outdir DIRNAME      :new directory for output (default: surflayers)

  -states IN OUT       :typically smoothwm, pial states to describe inner
                        and outer surfaces (default: "smoothwm pial")

  -hemi  HH            :choose hemisphere: "lh", "rh" or "lh rh" (for both)

  -n_intermed_surfs N  :total number of intermediate surfaces to create

  -surf_A      SB      :inner boundary surface by filename (e.g. smoothwm.gii)

  -surf_B      SA      :outer boundary surface by filename (e.g. pial.gii)

  -surf_intermed_pref SIP  :name for interpolated surfaces 
                        (default: isurf)
  
  -echo                :run script with 'set echo' (i.e., verbosely)

  -no_clean            :do not remove temp files (probably just for testing)

Notes ~1~

Output includes a new directory containing:
+ isurf.lh.01...n.gii -  interpolated surfaces numbered 1 to n
+ other files too if -spec option was utilized
+ a run*tcsh script to view the output directly

See also the quickspecSL program for creating a *.spec file.
