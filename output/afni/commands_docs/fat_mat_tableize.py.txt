  PURPOSE ~1~

  This program is to make tables for AFNI group analysis programs from
  outputs from 3dNetCorr (*.netcc) and 3dTrackID (*.grid).

  This program can also include additional subject information from
  CSV files (which can be saved/made from spreadsheet formats like
  XLS, XLSX, etc.).

INPUTS ~1~

  + A set of *.netcc or *.grid file output by 3dNetCorr or 3dTrackID,
    respectively.

  + (opt) a CSV file of subject data; note that 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUTS ~1~

  + a table file, usable in (many) AFNI group analysis programs

  + a log file reporting on the inputs, matching and other aspects of
    creating the table file

 -in_mat  IM1 IM2 IM3 ...
                :(req) name(s) of *.netcc or *.grid files with matrices
                 to be used to make table (probably more than one); the
                 list can be provided using wildcard chars, e.g.: 
                    group_dir/sub_*.grid 
                    sub_00?.netcc
                 (see also '-in_list ..' as an alternative method for 
                  inputting this information)

 -in_csv CSV    :(opt) name of a CSV file to include in table (just one).
                 The first column of the CSV must have subj ID labels
                 that can be matched with the filename/paths of the 
                 input matrix files.  If the subjects IDs cannot be 
                 unambiguously matched with the matrix files based on their
                 path/names, then you must use the '-in_list ..' option
                 to provide the matching explicitly

 -in_listfile LIST :(opt) another way of inputting the matrix (*.grid or
                 *.netcc) files-- by explicit path, matched per file
                 with a CSV subject ID.
                 The LIST text file contains two columns if also using 
                 a CSV:
                    col 1: path to subject matrix files
                    col 2: CSV IDs
                 Otherwise, if no CSV is being used, the file can contain
                 just one column of paths to the matrix files.
                 Note that lines in the LIST can contain #-ed comments.

 -prefix PP     :(req) output basename for the table and log files.  
                 Note that this can include path information, but both 
                 a suffix and a file extensions will be added for the
                 main outputs: 
                    _prep.log  (attached to the log file)
                    _tbl.txt   (attached to the table file)

 -pars PARS     :(opt) list of matrices to be included in the table, 
                 identified by their parameter name.  If no '-pars ..'  
                 list is provided, then all matrices in the input file 
                 will be included in the table (which might make for a 
                 veeery long table)
