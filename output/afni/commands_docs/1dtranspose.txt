Usage: 1dtranspose infile outfile
where infile is an AFNI *.1D file (ASCII list of numbers arranged
in columns); outfile will be a similar file, but transposed.
You can use a column subvector selector list on infile, as in
  1dtranspose 'fred.1D[0,3,7]' ethel.1D

* This program may produce files with lines longer than a
   text editor can handle.
* If 'outfile' is '-' (or missing entirely), output goes to stdout.
