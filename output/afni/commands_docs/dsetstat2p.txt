Overview ~1~ 

This program converts a statistic value to a p-value, with
reference to a particular dataset.

Often to convert a statistic to a p-value, supplementary
information is needed, such as number of degrees of freedom.  AFNI
programs that write statistics *do* store that info in headers, and
this program is meant to be a useful to do conversions based on
that info.  Here, the user provides the stat value and the specific [i]th
brick of the dataset in question, and a p-value (either as single number,
or with supplementary info) is output to screen.

This program should give equivalent results to other AFNI programs
like ccalc and cdf, but with less work by the user.

See also the complementary program for doing the inverse, converting
a p-value to an equivalent statistic:  p2dsetstat.

**Note that the user will have to choose explicitly whether they
  are doing one-sided or bi-sided/two-sided testing!** This is
  equivalent to choosing "Pos&Neg" or just "Pos" (or just "Neg",
  if the user multiplies the output by a negative) in the AFNI
  GUI's clickable p-to-statistic calculator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outputs ~1~ 

The types of statistic values that can be calculated are:
    corr coef, t-stat, F-stat or z-score.

If "-quiet" is used, then basically just a single number (the converted
p-value) is output.  See examples for saving this in a file or
variable.

Without the "-quiet" option, some descriptive text is also output with
the calculation, stating what kind of statistic is being used, etc.

Sidenote: another way to get stat+parameter information is via 3dAttribute,
and in particular asking for the "BRICK_STATAUX" information. That output
is probably a bit more cryptic, but it is described on the attributes page,
which users may look upon here:

Examples ~1~ 

In all cases note the use of the single quotes around the subbrick
selector-- these are necessary in some shell types!

1) Do a calculation and display various information to screen:
     dsetstat2p                                       \
         -inset   stats.sub01+tlrc"[2]"               \
         -statval 3.313                               \
         -bisided

2) Do a calculation and just display a single number (and also
   use a string label to conveniently select the subbrick):
     dsetstat2p                                       \
         -inset   stats.sub01+tlrc"[Full_Fstat]"    \

         -1sided                                      \
         -quiet

3) Do a calculation and store the output number as a variable,
   here using tcsh syntax:
     set my_stat = `dsetstat2p                        \
                     -inset   stats.sub02+tlrc"[8]"   \
                     -statval 3.313                   \

                     -quiet`

4) Do a calculation and store the output number into a text
   file:
     dsetstat2p                                       \
         -inset   stats.sub02+tlrc"[8]"               \
