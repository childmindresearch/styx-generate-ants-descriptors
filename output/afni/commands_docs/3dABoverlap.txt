=== Output of '3dABoverlap -help' ===

Usage: 3dABoverlap [options] A B
Output (to screen) is a count of various things about how
the automasks of datasets A and B overlap or don't overlap.

* Dataset B will be resampled to match dataset A, if necessary,
   which will be slow if A is high resolution.  In such a case,
   you should only use one sub-brick from dataset B.
  ++ The resampling of B is done before the automask is generated.
* The values output are labeled thusly:
    #A         = number of voxels in the A mask
    #B         = number of voxels in the B mask
    #(A uni B) = number of voxels in the either or both masks (set union)
    #(A int B) = number of voxels present in BOTH masks (set intersection)
    #(A \ B)   = number of voxels in A mask that aren't in B mask
    #(B \ A)   = number of voxels in B mask that aren't in A mask
    %(A \ B)   = percentage of voxels from A mask that aren't in B mask
    %(B \ A)   = percentage of voxels from B mask that aren't in A mask
    Rx(B/A)    = radius of gyration of B mask / A mask, in x direction
    Ry(B/A)    = radius of gyration of B mask / A mask, in y direction
    Rz(B/A)    = radius of gyration of B mask / A mask, in z direction
* If B is an EPI dataset sub-brick, and A is a skull stripped anatomical
   dataset, then %(B \ A) might be useful for assessing if the EPI
   brick B is grossly misaligned with respect to the anatomical brick A.
* The radius of gyration ratios might be useful for determining if one
   dataset is grossly larger or smaller than the other.

OPTIONS
-------
 -no_automask = consider input datasets as masks
                (automask does not work on mask datasets)
 -quiet = be as quiet as possible (without being entirely mute)
 -verb  = print out some progress reports (to stderr)

NOTES
-----
 * If an input dataset is comprised of bytes and contains only one
   sub-brick, then this program assumes it is already an automask-
   generated dataset and the automask operation will be skipped.
