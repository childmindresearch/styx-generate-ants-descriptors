Option #1 --help not understood. 
Try -help for usage
   Here's hoping these excerpts from '/opt/afni/src/../install/3dGenFeatureDist -help' enlighten:
        '-OTHER: Add histograms for an 'OTHER' class that has a uniform pdf.'
        '-hspec FEATURE MIN MAX NBINS: Set histogram parameters for feature FEATURE'
        '-no_OTHER: Opposite of -OTHER.'

3dGenFeatureDist produces hives.
   -classes 'CLASS_STRING': CLASS_STRING is a semicolon delimited
                         string of class labels. For example
                         -classes 'CSF; WM; GM'

   -OTHER: Add histograms for an 'OTHER' class that has a uniform pdf.

   -no_OTHER: Opposite of -OTHER.

   -features 'FEATURES_STRING': FEATURES_STRING is a semicolon delimited
                         string of features. For example
                         -features 'MEAN.00_mm; median.19_mm; ...'

   -sig 'FEATURE_VOL1 FEATURE_VOL2 ...': Specify volumes that define
                         the features. Each sub-brick is a feature
                         and the sub-brick's name is used to name the 
                         feature. Multiple volumes get catenated.
                         Each occurrence of -sig option must be paired with
                         a -samp option. Think of each pair of '-sig, -samp'
                         options as describing data on the same voxel grid; 
                         Think from the same subject. When specifying 
                         training data from K subjects, you will end up using
                         K pairs of '-sig, -samp'.
                         All volumes from the kth -sig instance should have 
                         the same voxel grid as each other and as that of
                         the kth -samp datasets.

   -samp 'SAMPLE_VOX1 SAMPLE_VOX2 ...': Specify which voxels belong to
                         each class of interest. Each of the volumes
                         should contain voxel values (keys) that are
                         defined in -labeltable. You can specify multiple
                         volumes, they all get catenated. Any volume can
                         contain voxels from 1 or more classes.
                         Each occurrence of -samp option must be paired with
                         a -sig option. Think of each pair of '-sig, -samp'
                         options as describing data on the same voxel grid; 
                         Think from the same subject. When specifying 
                         training data from K subjects, you will end up using
                         K pairs of '-sig, -samp'.
                         All volumes from the kth -samp instance should have 
                         the same voxel grid as each other and as that of
                         the kth -sig datasets.

   -hspec FEATURE MIN MAX NBINS: Set histogram parameters for feature FEATURE
                              FEATURE: String label of feature
                              MIN, MAX: Range of histogram
                              NBINS: Number of bins
        Use this option to set the histogram parameters for the features for
        the automatic parameter selection was lousy. You can specify 
        for multiple features by using multiple -hspec instances. The only
        condition is that all feature labels (FEATURE) must be part of the 
        set named in -features.

   -prefix PREF: PREF is the prefix for all output volume that are not 
              debugging related.

     default: GenFeatDist
   -ShowTheseHists HISTNAMES: Show histograms specified by HISTNAMES and quit.
              HISTNAMES can specify just one .niml.hist file or a bunch of 
              them using a space, or comma separated list. 
              List multiple names between quotes.

   -overwrite: An option common to almost all AFNI programs. It is 
            automatically turned on if you provide no PREF.

   -debug: Debugging level

     default: 1
   -labeltable LT: Specify the label table

     default: 1
