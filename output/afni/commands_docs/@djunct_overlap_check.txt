NOTES TO SELF ~1~

This is mostly useful if the olay has no skull and the ulay has a
skull, in terms of being able to see overlap well.

If using -box_focus_slices, don't use the AMASK_FOCUS_OLAY keyword,
but instead repeat the name of the olay explicitly.  This is because
this program creates an edgified version of the olay, which gets
passed into @chauffeur_afni, and then using the AMASK* functionality
would try to 'automask' that dset, typically leaves no voxels and
leads to an error.  Repeating the name of the input olay leads to
correct behavior.  (Ask me how I discovered *this* tidbit of
knowledge?)
