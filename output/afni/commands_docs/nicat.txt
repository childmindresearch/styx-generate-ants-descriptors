** NI_stream_open fails

=== Output of 'nicat -help' ===

Usage: nicat [-reopen rr] [-rR] streamspec
Copies stdin to the NIML stream, which will be opened
for writing.

-reopen rr == reopen the stream after connection
               to the stream specified by 'rr'
-r         == Copy the stream to stdout instead; the
               'streamspec' will be opened for reading.
-R         == Read the stream but don't copy to stdout.

Intended for testing other programs that use NIML for
various services.  Example:
  aiv -p 4444 &
  im2niml zork.jpg | nicat tcp:localhost:4444
Starts aiv listening on TCP/IP port 444, then sends image
file zork.jpg to that port for display.
