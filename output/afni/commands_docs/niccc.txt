   Usage: niccc [-dup] [-nodata] streamspec

A program for conducting certain NIML tests 
on input from streamspec and write the results to stderr

Example:
    niccc file:Something.niml 

Mandatory arguments:
   streamspec: A string defining a NIML stream.

Options:
   -dup: Duplicate the element before showing it.
         This is to test NI_duplicate function.
   -nodata: Show header parts only in output
   -attribute ATTR: Dump the value of attribute ATTR
   -match MATCH: If MATCH is exact, then attribute name
                 is matched exactly. If MATCH is partial,
                 then a match of all the characters in ATTR
                 is enough. For example, an ATTR of COEF would
                 match any of COEF COEF.1 COEF.2, etc.
            Default is -match exact
   -f: streamspec is a filename.
   -s: streamspec is an element string like: 
            '<T font=9 coords="2.3 23 2"/>'
   -stdout: write elements to stdout, instead of stderr
   -#: put the # at the beginning of lines with no data
   -quiet: quiet stderr messages, and don't echo attribute
           name with -attribute option
   -find_nel_with_attr ATTR ATTRVAL: Only output elements 
               that have an attribute ATTR of value ATTRVAL.
               a status of 1 is returned if no match is found.
   -skip_nel_with_attr ATTR ATTRVAL: Do not output elements 
               that have an attribute ATTR of value ATTRVAL.
   niccc returns a status of 0 if it the stream opened.
         and there were no interruptions.
