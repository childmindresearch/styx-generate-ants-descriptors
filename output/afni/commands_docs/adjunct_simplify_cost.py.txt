Subsidiary of @SSwarper, not really a program deserving a
help message.

Just takes one argument: a cost function name.

This program will remove the '+' and anything following it from a cost
function's name.  For example:
    lpa+ZZ  ->  lpa
    lpc+    ->  lpc
    lpa+hel:1.0+crA:0.4+nmi:0.2+ov:0.4+ZZ -> lpa
