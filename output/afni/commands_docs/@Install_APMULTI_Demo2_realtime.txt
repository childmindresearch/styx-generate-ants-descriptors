Overview ~1~

This script fetches the demo data+scripts corresponding to AFNI's Demo #2
for experimenting with AFNI's real-time system, possibly in the context of
multi-echo data.  This demonstrates commands one can use to run a real-time
system, mimicking what happens at a scanner.

The applied programs are:

   Dimon                : to send data to afni
   afni                 : volreg, possibly send data to realtime_receiver.py
   realtime_receiver.py : to receive (and possibly print) some data from afni
                          (motion, ROI averages?, voxel data?)

After the archive is downloaded and unpacked, see its README_welcome.txt
for details.

Options ~1~

   [-wget] : Use wget to download archive. Script chooses by default
             with preference for curl
   [-curl] : Use curl to download archive. Script chooses by default
             with preference for curl

Examples ~1~

1) Just get everything, default operation:

    @Install_APMULTI_Demo2_realtime

2) Get everything, specify download tool:

    @Install_APMULTI_Demo2_realtime -wget

              Welcome to APMULTI demo 02 - realtime
                (AFNI realtime system processing)

This package demonstrates much of the common functionality of AFNI's real-time
system.  The input is a collection of 12 volumes, initially stored as:

   DICOM with a single echo
   DICOM with 3 echoes
   NIFTI with a single echo


To run the complete set of scripts, it is enough to:

   tcsh run.regress

This relies on cmd.regress, which might backup the regression comparison files
(some of the log/* text files).  It can also be run to clean the old results
(see clean_rt in cmd.regress).  This full script takes about 75 seconds to run
(presently), mostly due to 'sleep' statements between script pieces.



To run a single realtime process (e.g. with rt.00.basic), one can:

   cd rt.00.basic
   tcsh run.8.all

This will run all scripts in that directory.

Alternatively, one might want to run and monitor the scripts.  In this case,
one would usually run a single script per terminal window (using 3 or 4 
terminal windows, depending), as in:

   cd rt.00.basic
   tcsh run.0.receiver
   tcsh run.1.afni
   tcsh run.2.dimon
   tcsh run.3.stats

There is also a run.9.cleanup script in each directory.
