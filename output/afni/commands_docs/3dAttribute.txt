3dAttribute [options] aname dset

Prints (to stdout) the value of the attribute 'aname' from
the header of dataset 'dset'.  If the attribute doesn't exist,
prints nothing and sets the exit status to 1.

See the full list of attributes in README.attributes here:
  https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/README.attributes.html

Options ~1~

  -name = Include attribute name in printout
  -all  = Print all attributes [don't put aname on command line]
          Also implies '-name'.  Attributes print in whatever order
          they are in the .HEAD file, one per line.  You may want
          to do '3dAttribute -all elvis+orig | sort' to get them
          in alphabetical order.
  -center = Center of volume in RAI coordinates.
            Note that center is not itself an attribute in the 
           .HEAD file. It is calculated from other attributes.

  Special options for string attributes:

    -ssep SSEP    Use string SSEP as a separator between strings for
                  multiple sub-bricks. The default is '~', which is what
                  is used internally in AFNI's .HEAD file. For tcsh,
                  I recommend ' ' which makes parsing easy, assuming each
                  individual string contains no spaces to begin with.
                  Try -ssep 'NUM'
    -sprep SPREP  Use string SPREP to replace blank space in string 
                  attributes.
    -quote        Use single quote around each string.

Examples ~1~

  3dAttribute -quote -ssep ' '  BRICK_LABS SomeStatDset+tlrc.HEAD

  3dAttribute -quote -ssep 'NUM' -sprep '+' BRICK_LABS SomeStatDset+tlrc.HEAD

  3dAttribute BRICK_STATAUX SomeStatDset+tlrc.HEAD'[0]'
  # ... which outputs information for just the [0]th brick of a dset.
  # If that dset were an F-stat, then the output might look like:
  #    0 4 2 2 430
  # ... which, in order, translate to:
  #    0 --> the index of the brick in question
  #    4 --> the brick's statistical code, findable in README.attributes:
  #          '#define FUNC_FT_TYPE    4  /* fift: F-statistic */'
  #          to be an F-statistic
  #    2 --> the number of parameters for that stat (shown subsequently)
  #    2 --> here, the 1st parameter for the F-stat: 'Numerator DOF'
  #  430 --> here, the 2nd parameter for the F-stat: 'Denominator DOF'
