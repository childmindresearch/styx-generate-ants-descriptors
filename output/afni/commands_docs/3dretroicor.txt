=== Output of '3dretroicor -help' ===

Usage: 3dretroicor [options] dataset

Performs Retrospective Image Correction for physiological
motion effects, using a slightly modified version of the
RETROICOR algorithm described in:

  Glover, G. H., Li, T., & Ress, D. (2000). Image-based method
for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in
fMRI: RETROICOR. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 44, 162-167.

Options (defaults in []'s):

 -ignore    = The number of initial timepoints to ignore in the
              input (These points will be passed through
              uncorrected) [0]
 -prefix    = Prefix for new, corrected dataset [retroicor]

 -card      = 1D cardiac data file for cardiac correction
 -cardphase = Filename for 1D cardiac phase output
 -threshold = Threshold for detection of R-wave peaks in input
              (Make sure it's above the background noise level;
              Try 3/4 or 4/5 times range plus minimum) [1]

 -resp      = 1D respiratory waveform data for correction
 -respphase = Filename for 1D resp phase output

 -order     = The order of the correction (2 is typical;
              higher-order terms yield little improvement
              according to Glover et al.) [2]

 -help      = Display this message and stop (must be first arg)

Dataset: 3D+time dataset to process

** The input dataset and at least one of -card and -resp are
    required.

NOTES
-----

The durations of the physiological inputs are assumed to equal
the duration of the dataset. Any constant sampling rate may be
used, but 40 Hz seems to be acceptable. This program's cardiac
peak detection algorithm is rather simplistic, so you might try
using the scanner's cardiac gating output (transform it to a
spike wave if necessary).

This program uses slice timing information embedded in the
dataset to estimate the proper cardiac/respiratory phase for
each slice. It makes sense to run this program before any
program that may destroy the slice timings (e.g. 3dvolreg for
motion correction).

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
