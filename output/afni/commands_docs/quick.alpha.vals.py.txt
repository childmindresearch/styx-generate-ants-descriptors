quick.alpha.vals.py   - make an alpha table from slow_surf_clustsim.py results

   Run this on each z.max.area file output by slow_surf_clustsim.py.  In some
   cases the z.max.area might not have as many lines as iterations, for which
   the -niter option can be applied.

   usage: quick.alpha.vals.py [-niter N] max_file

       -niter: number of iterations that should be in the z file

            ** Note: -niter should match that from slow_surf_clustsim.py.

   This pathetic program will surely be enhanced.  Someday.
