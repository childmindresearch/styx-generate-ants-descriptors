afni_history:           show AFNI updates per user, dates or levels

This program is meant to display a log of updates to AFNI code, the
website, educational material, etc.  Users can specify a level of
importance, the author, program or how recent the changes are.

The levels of importance go from 1 to 4, with meanings:
       1 - users would not care
       2 - of little importance, though some users might care
       3 - fairly important
       4 - a big change or new program
       5 - IMPORTANT: we expect users to know

-----------------------------------------------------------------

common examples:

  0. get help

     a. afni_history -help

  1. display all of the history, possibly subject to recent days/entries

     a. afni_history
     b. afni_history -past_days 5
     c. afni_history -past_months 6
     d. afni_history -past_entries 1

  2. select a specific type, level or minimum level

     a. afni_history -level 2
     b. afni_history -min_level 3 -type BUG_FIX
     c. afni_history -type 1 -min_level 3 -past_years 1

  3. select a specific author or program

     a. afni_history -author rickr
     b. afni_history -program afni_proc.py

     display the past year of updates for rickr, sorted by program name...

     c. afni_history -author rickr -past_days 365 -final_sort_by_prog

  4. select level 3+ suma updates from ziad over the past year

     a. afni_history -author ziad -min_level 3 -program suma

  5. generate a web-page, maybe from the past year at at a minimum level

     a. afni_history -html -reverse > afni_hist_all.html
     b. afni_history -html -reverse -min_level 2  > afni_hist_level2.html
     c. afni_history -html -reverse -min_level 3  > afni_hist_level3.html
     d. afni_history -html -reverse -min_level 4  > afni_hist_level4.html

  5. verify that the distribution is new enough

     Compare the most recent history entry against the passed date.  If
     there is a history entry as recent as the given date, it is current.
     Otherwise, the distribution is considered old.

     a. afni_history -check_date 1 1 2010
     b. afni_history -check_date 15 Mar 2050

  6. show particular fields

     a. show the program name for the most recent 10 entries
           afni_history -show_field program 10
     b. show the program name for the most recent 10 NEW_PROG entries
           afni_history -type NEW_PROG -show_field program 10
     c. show the authors of the past 10 BUG_FIX entries
           afni_history -type BUG_FIX -show_field author 10
     d. show all unique program fields, sorted
           afni_history -show_field program | sort | uniq
     e. show all unique program fields of NEW_PROG entries, sorted
           afni_history -show_field program -type NEW_PROG | sort | uniq

  ----  log of AFNI updates (most recent last)  ----

24 Jul 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 5 (SUPERDUPER), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Oldest History stuff

    AFNI was created in summer 1994 (but some parts date to the 1980s).
    However, no formal log was made of changes until this date in 1996.
    So this is the beginning of AFNI historiography.
      'Lately it occurs to me: What a long, strange trip it's been.'

25 Jul 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added Button 2 click (time_index += 1 or -= 1) to afni_graph.c
       [N.B.: this change was later removed with the drawing plugin.]

29 Jul 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added shadow color changing code to 'colormenu' widgets in bbox.c --
       this gives a little visual feedback when a color is selected.
    * Used 'glob' routines from tcsh-6.05 to allow filename globbing
       on non-POSIX systems without the glob routines (like SGIs).

30 Jul 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified MCW_file_expand routine to properly glob files specified
       in the form 3D:a:b:c:d:e:fname, where only 'fname' will have the
       wildcards.  To3d help printout now reflects this change.
    * Used fsync(fileno()) to ensure that writes of .BRIK files are
       flushed to disk -- in afni_func.c and 3ddata.c.
    * Don't do shadow color changing in 'colormenus' unless the widget is
       realized, since this causes BadDrawable error on Linux (Motif 2.0).
    * Changed most popup widgets to be of class 'menu', which means that
       their background color can now be changed separately.
    * Changed operation of -R option in afni to limit levels of recursion.
       Mostly involved changing the routine THD_get_all_subdirs in 3ddata.c.

31 Jul 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Changed to3d to prevent creation of 3D+time functional datasets.
       Modified to3d -help to reflect this, and added 'Nz = %d' to the
       3D+time information label in the to3d widget panel.

01 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified imseq.c and afni.c to allow the user to toggle between
       periodic montages and 'no wrap' montages.  Added a toggle button
       'Wrap' next to the crosshair 'Gap' menu.
    * Modified crosshairs in afni.c so that in 'Single' mode with a
       grapher active, then only the frame showing the graphed voxels
       is drawn.  In 'Multi' mode, both the frame and the crosshairs
       will be shown.

02 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified FD2.c to show average pixel value over frame as well as time,
       when 'AvIm' is being used.   Also added 'b' keypress to toggle
       common baselines for graphs.
    * Added SEEK_ constants back to mri_read.c, since C compiler on sparky
       doesn't have them in stdio.h.
    * Fixed 'afni -im' problem with inversion of top_form during waits --
       the program didn't turn the inversion off correctly.  This error
       was due to the 'dangling else' problem.  The addition of a {}
       pair fixed it right up.  Moral of the story: don't be stupid.

06 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in afni_slice.c about the new NN code.  The code
       now doesn't use the 'parallel' fast mode unless both the
       inner and outer axes are parallel.
    * Fixed a bug in 3ddata.c, where the taxis wasn't properly set on
       input of a 3D+t dataset if no slice offset data was input.
       This would cause a crash when trying to delete a dataset.
    * Added '-warp_4D' switch to afni to allow output of 3D+t datasets
       in Talairach coordinate.  Consumes huge amounts of disk space
       and CPU time.
    * Removed fsync() because of time penalty.

07 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed another bug in afni_slice.c about the new NN code.  The
       allocation macro MAKE_IBIG failed to take into account that
       the array ib[] index would run from 0..'top', and it only
       allocated 'top' entries, whereas it should do at least 'top+1'.

08 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added '-gfisher' option to 3dmerge.c, for purpose of averaging
       correlation coefficient bricks.  Fixed a bug in this program
       that took the DSET_BRICK_FACTOR from the input dataset
       before editing, which is a mistake, since editing might alter
       this scaling factor.
    * Changed output format from %14.7g to %13.6g in 3dinfo.c.  This
       tends to suppress the annoying roundoff error in the scaled
       statistics report.

09 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed scaling bug in editvol.c EDIT_one_dataset's clip code.
       For shorts scaled to floats, clip values were computed as
       integers, which gave truncation errors in some cases.  Now,
       clip values are computed as floats, then converted to
       integers, with appropriate min- and max-ing.
    * Also added -1uclip and -2uclip options to EDIT_.  See
       '3dmerge -help' for information.

13 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Altered autoRange and userRange controls (in Define Function
       control panel) in afni to
         a) always allow the user to set the range, even for thresholds
         b) eliminate the inversion to indicate the autoRange is on
         c) compute the autoRange for thresholds as well as fims
       These changes also eliminate a bug (feature?) where the user could
       set 'Func=Threshold' (SHOWFUNC_THR), which would formerly disable
       these controls, then switch to another dataset where they would
       not properly be re-enabled.
    * Added function AFNI_rescan_session to afni_func.c, which will close
       all the datasets in a session, then re-read the session directory
       to make a new set of datasets.  At present, this is actuated from
       the 'hidden' popup menu.  Tricky points are catching all pointers
       to datasets that are in the rescanned session, since they will
       change, and dealing with the case when the user deletes some
       dataset files.

28 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed routine T3D_fix_dataset_dimen() in to3d.c to clear the
       data brick pointers of the OLD number of bricks, not the
       NEW number of bricks.  This error caused to3d to crash when
       going from a dataset type with large nvals to small nvals,
       since some sub-brick pointers were not being properly cleared.
       [This error only manifested itself on SGI machines, and
        was found by Christopher Wiggins.]
    * Made all routines in mri_write.c return a count of the number
       of files they successfully wrote out (instead of returning void,
       as before).  [This change was prompted by Doug Ward.]

29 Aug 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * If a session directory has functions but no anatomies, then
       afni.c now prints out a warning message instead of just
       skipping it silently.  [Prompted by Chris Wiggins.]
    * If a dataset has parent IDCODEs, then the corresponding
       parent name will not be set in 3ddata.c.  This is to prevent
       confusion.

01 Sep 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Moved rescan pushbutton from hidden menu to datamode control panel.
    * Modified 3dmerge.c to allow merger of thresholds in datasets as
       well as intensities.  Uses a new '-t*' type of flag -- the only
       one implemented so far is '-tfico', which requires all inputs
       to be of the fico dataset type.  See the '-gfisher' merger mode
       given earlier.

07 Sep 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified -tfico option in 3dmerge.c to allow some of the datasets
       to be of the fith type.  If all of them are fico, then the output
       will be fico (with degrees-of-freedom parameters summed), otherwise
       the output will just be fith.
    * Added '-q' == 'be quiet' option to fim2.

30 Sep 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * After several false starts, finally begin creation of plugin code.
       This is after conversations with Mike Beauchamp and Jay Kummer.
       Yesterday and today
         - afni_plugin.h has interface structures defined;
         - afni_plugin.c has interface definition routines and
             widget creation routines;
         - machdep.h has new #define's to set the type of
             dynamic library loading to use.
       Much more to come.
    * Modified MCW_widget_geom in xutil.h to properly deal with
       the case of unrealized widgets -- must use XtQueryGeometry
       instead of XtGetValues.

06 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed use of '==' in assignment statement in 3ddata.h.
    * afni_plugin.c now has
       - working widget creation and popup routines
       - plugin callable routines to extract values from
           user selected options from the interface

07 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Changed 3ddata.c to allow use of AFNI_TS_PATH as an alternate
       to AFNI_TSPATH.  If neither environment variable exists,
       then the path './' will be used as a last resort.
    * Something similar done in afni_plug.c with AFNI_PLUGIN_PATH.
    * Made the switchview callback in afni.c pop down the strlist
       chooser.  This is because a plugin interface will only be
       allowed to choose from current view datasets, and if such
       a view switch is made, the list of choosable datasets must
       be modified.  The simplest way to do this is to make the
       user start the choice process over.

09 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in afni_plugin.c that failed to check certain
       datasets for inclusion in the dataset choosers.
    * Modified BHelp to include color and border controls.
    * Incorporated Doug Ward's changed version of editvol.[hc],
       which adds various cluster editing and volume filtering
       options to 3dmerge.c (et al.).

11 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed (sort of) sizing problem in afni_plugin.c creation
       of plugin interface windows.
    * Wrote routine for plugin to load a new dataset into the
       current session of a controller window.

12 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * afni_plugin.c changes
       - Modified PLUGIN_prefix_ok in afni_plugin.c to check for
           duplicate prefixes, as well as for illegal characters in
           the prefix string.
       - Routine PLUGIN_force_redisplay will make all im3d units
           redraw their windows.
       - Routine PLUGIN_copy_dset will copy a dataset, including
           the bricks.
       - Added helpstring to the plugin interface, and a 'Help'
           button to popup a plugin-supplied message.
    * Modified afni to allow separate control of warp-on-demand for
       anatomy and functional datasets.  When a plugin directly
       modifies a Talairach dataset brick, for example, then if it
       is set to warp-on-demand, the display won't be affected,
       since the program always warps from the +orig brick.  Under
       the old scheme, if the anat were w-o-d, then the func had
       to be w-o-d as well.  In the situation where the anat dataset
       brick does not exist in Talairach coords, then the effect of
       the plugin would be invisible if the user couldn't force
       the function to be view-brick independent of the anatomy.
    * Fixed an old bug in THD_dset_in_sessionlist (3ddata.c) that
       returned the wrong session index.

14 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in 3ddata.h macro FILECODE_TO_PREFIX so that the
       last '+' in the filecode is used to find the prefix,
       rather than the first '+'.  This fixes a problem with
       datasets whose prefix contains a '+' character.

18 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_read.c so that '# line' comments in pgm files
       can be read.  This lets AFNI programs read pgm files created
       from programs like 'xv'.
    * Changed plugin callable functions/macros in afni_plugin.[ch]
       to start with PLUTO (PLugin UTility Operation).

20 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bugs in imseq.c
       - During 'image processing' of complex images, one reference to
           input image 'im' had not been changed to 'lim' (the locally
           processed copy).
       - If ISQ_make_image fails, the XImage 'seq->given_xim' would
           be NULL.  This is now detected, and ISQ_show_image won't
           try to put this NULL image to the screen (which would
           cause a Segmentation error).
    * Minor changes to afni_plugin.c
       - Added reminder of current 'view' at top of plugin dataset chooser.
       - Added [c] reminder of current controller in plugin shell widget
           titlebar and icon label strings.
    * Minor changes to afni_graph.c
       - Changed time increment event from Button2 to Shift or Ctrl
           with Button1.  This is to allow the eventual dedication of
           Button2 events to plugins.

21 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Changed FD_brick_to_timeseries (in 3ddata.c) to scale each element
       by the brick_fac value appropriate for that time index, rather
       than by the value for time index = 0.  This is done using the
       new routine mri_mult_to_float (in mri_to_float.c).
    * Fixed bug in EDIT_dset_items (editvol.h) that used 'float' inputs.
       Default type promotion (there can be no prototype here) turns all
       float inputs to doubles, so they must be retrieved this way.
       Also, fixed error when 'ADN_nsl' is passed as zero -- no longer
       requires a 'ADN_toff_sl' array in this special case.  Also made
       EDERR macro always print a message, even if not in debug mode.
    * Added DSET_TIMESTEP macro (and others) to 3ddata.h.
    * Modified PLUTO_add_dset (afni_plugin.c) to allow for other actions
       when a dataset is set back to AFNI.
    * Added 'progress meter' PLUTO_ functions to afni_plugin.c; also
       modified the meter code in xutil.c to check if the percent
       value has changed before trying to update the meter progress.
    * Added 'units_type' to the 3D+time dataset format.  This lets the
       'time axis' be expressed in milliseconds, seconds, or Hertz.
       Changes were made to 3ddata.[ch], to3d.c, 3dinfo.c, editvol.[ch].
    * Power spectrum plugin 'plug_power.c' was made to work today.

22 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added timeseries chooser to afni_plugin.c.
    * Added ability to apply a function to graph data (e.g., to take the
       logarithm of each point).  This affected afni.[ch], afni_graph.[ch].
    * Fixed a bug in afni_fimmer.c, where routine AFNI_ts_in_library could
       return the wrong value if the timeseries being searched for was
       not actually found.
    * Modified directory scan in 3ddata.c (for timeseries) and afni_plugin.c
       (for plugins) to skip directories that have already be scanned.
       This is to avoid the situation where the PATH variable contains
       duplicate entries.

23 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added Shift/Ctrl/Alt-Button3 simulation of lower tier button presses
       to imseq.c.

25 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed imseq.c routine that re-places the 'dialog' window (for Disp
       and Mont) on the screen when the image is resized -- somehow
       the code that fixed the problem of forcing the dialog off the
       edge of the screen lost an '=', and so nothing happened.
    * Added 'i' button to right edge of imseq.c windows -- allows the
       user to down/up the fraction of the window that the image
       takes up.

27 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added PLUTO_popup_image() function to afni_plugin.c.  Also used
       this to provide a 'hidden menu' popup of an image of me in
       afni_func.c.

30 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added ability to apply function to each pixel of a displayed image
       (cognate to the similar ability in graphs -- see 22 October).
       This primarily affected imseq.c, but also a few other places.
    * Added new 'fift' dataset type, to deal with F-test sub-bricks.
       - Incorporated cdflib into mrilib.  This is to use the 'cdff'
           to compute the CDF for the F statistic, in mri_stats.c
       - Changed the precision of the threshold scale (thr_scale)
           from 0..99 to 0..999, and correspondingly changed the
           scaling from the scale to func_threshold from 0.01 to
           0.001.  Also changed the 'decim' factor for the scale.

31 Oct 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified EDIT_substitute_brick in editvol.c to allow the input
       array 'fim' to be NULL.  In that case, the routine will create it.
       This is a convenience for the user (say, a plugin author).

01 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine PLUTO_4D_to_typed_fim to afni_plugin.c.  This takes
       a user function and a 3D+time dataset, and returns fim dataset,
       with the user function applied to each voxel timeseries.

02 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a major bug with the multiple controller window ('New'
       button) extension.  The problem is that the information about
       how to extract images from a dataset is stored in the dataset,
       in the 'wod_daxes' and 'vox_warp' sub-structs.  This causes
       difficulties when two controllers view the same dataset at
       different resolutions (e.g., overlay the same function on
       two different anatomies).  The fix is to put the originals
       of 'wod_daxes', 'vox_warp', and 'wod_flag' into the controller
       (im3d) struct itself.  When the dataset is going to be used,
       then this information is copied into the dataset struct.
       This is a clumsy fix, but breaks the least code in the
       afni_warp.c routines for extracting slices from a dataset.

03 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Moved functional resample arrowval from the 'Define Function'
       control panel to the 'Define Datamode' panel, where it will
       be close to the analogous control from anatomy.
    * Added 1D and 2D transformation function registries.  Made up
       some sample transformation functions (median filtering, etc.).
    * Added time units appendage to TR in to3d.c.

04 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'Lock' menu to Datamode panel.  This allows the user to
       specify that certain controllers have their coordinates locked
       together, so that jumping around in one dataset can be mirrored
       by jumps in another.  At this time, the AFNI_transform_vector
       function does not properly transform vectors from +tlrc coordinates
       to +orig coordinates (say) if the two datasets are not in the
       parent/child relationship.  This can be confusing if two such
       datasets are locked, and they are not in the same 'view'.
    * Made pressing Button1 on the AFNI logo in a grapher window also
       turn off/on the menubar widgets.  This enables a screen dump
       of a graph without that extraneous stuff being present.

06 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added -unique option to afni.c to allow creation of unique
       display contexts (MCW_DC's) for each AFNI controller window.
       (This won't work on 8 bit displays.)  afni.c and afni_widg.c
       were changed appropriately (and afni.h).

10 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Wrote 'lsqfit' plugin.  This allows computation of least squares
       fits to timeseries graphs.  Modified afni_graph.c to allow
       'Double Plot' to overlay least squares fit graph (or other
       output of a 'Tran 1D') on the data timeseries graph.

12 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug with multiple displays and the 'lock' -- when
       changing the dataset in an AFNI controller, you don't want
       the coordinate lock to apply.
    * Started adding 'orts' to AFNI's interactive fimmery.

19 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made afni.c (AFNI_setup_viewing routine) set the FIM-able dataset
       to the newly activated anatomical, if possible.  In the old
       version, if you switched anatomies, the FIM-able dataset didn't
       switch with you.  This was confusing to the uninitiated masses
       (that is to say, Mike Beauchamp).

21 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Incorporated the f2c (Fortran-to-C) converter into the AFNI96
       distribution, in a separate directory (f2cdir).  This allows
       the use of the old 'parser.f' routines to compile and execute
       user created expressions.
    * Added macro AVOPT_columnize to bbox.h, which allows the setup
       of an optmenu in a multicolumn layout.  Also setup the 'Plugins'
       button to allow this (when the number of plugins grows past 20).

22 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Adapted MCW_choose_strlist (in bbox.c) to allow selection of
       multiple items from the list.

23 Nov 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Rearranged Write buttons on Datamode control panel in AFNI.  Added
       a write 'Many' button which lets the user pick lots of datasets
       to write out, so he can go get a cup of coffee.  Put all 3 Write
       buttons in a single row.
    * Added a Rescan All button to allow rescanning of all sessions.  Put
       both Rescan buttons in a single row.  Also added a '*.1D' rescan
       button to allow for re-reading of timeseries files.
    * Attached data type descriptors like [fim] and [epan:3D+t] to the
       listings in the dataset choosers.

10 Dec 1996, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed small bugs in parser_int.c, in the utility routines where
       a pointer to a doublereal wasn't dereferenced before comparing
       it to zero.

01 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routines to libmri.a to allow reading in a 3D: image file
       in 'delay' mode -- only the filename and offset into it are
       stored in the image.  When access to the image is desired,
       then it will be read from disk.
    * Added -delay switch to to3d.c to take advantage of this procedure.
       This prevents duplicate malloc required for huge 3D: file
       (once for the 3D: input and once for the dataset brick).  People
       who do all 3D+time input data in one big file have run out of
       memory otherwise.
    * Added '++' toggle to allow display of crosshairs in all slices of
       an AFNI montage.  This is specifically for Jeff Binder.
    * Added RESET_AFNI_QUIT() calls to a bunch of routines in afni.c.

02 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added mcw_glob.c usage to FD2.c, to allow internal expansion of
       wildcarded filename.  This overcomes the SGI limit on the
       number of arguments on the command line.

03 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Got program waver.c to work -- generation of an ideal waveform
       with tunable parameters.

13 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added -subort option to fim2.c -- subtraction of orts from
       an image time series.

20 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Included '#include <string.h>' in mcw_glob.h, to prevent complaints
       from stupid compilers.
    * Added Makefile.osf1, from a system at U Maryland.
    * Added gmovie, script to create a GIF movie from a bunch of PNM files.

21 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made the 'fscale' element in a grapher (afni_graph.[hc]) be a float,
       so that finer control over graph scaling is possible.
    * Changed 'Scale', 'Ignore', and 'Matrix' controls in graph window
       to be optmenus.  Added a routine to allow optmenus to be refitted.

22 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made the control buttons on image viewers (imseq.c) a little smaller.

30 Jan 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program 3dcalc.c.
    * Changed STEP function in parser.f to be 1 only for x > 0.

14 Feb 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Incorporated GNU malloc into afni.c, which will be enabled with
       the #define-ition of USE_GNU_MALLOC (e.g., in machdep.h).
    * #define-ing NO_FRIVOLITIES in machdep.h will no disable the
       picture and sonnets.

16 Feb 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Incorporated GNU malloc checking into 'dafni'.  Now checks the
       status of all malloc-ed blocks on entry and exit to every
       routine using 'ENTRY' and 'RETURN' macros.  (Nevertheless,
       this still doesn't find the bug I'm looking for.)
    * When a grapher window is being destroyed, its corresponding
       image window needs to redraw the crosshairs.  This redraw
       command could cause a crash (for reasons unknown) when
       the dataset is being changed (that is, the grapher is being
       trashed because the new dataset does not support graphs).
       This is fixed in afni.c and afni_func.c so that when a
       grapher is destroyed due to underlay switching, then the
       corresponding image redraw commands will be ignored.

18 Feb 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added some logical functions (and, or, mofn) to parser.f, and
       so to 3dcalc.  Also added the -session option, and made the
       default session = './'.

20 Feb 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Moved a couple routines in afni_plugin.c outside the
       '#ifdef ALLOW_PLUGINS ... #endif' code block since they
       are used in non-plugin-specific parts of AFNI.

23 Feb 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Wrote plug_imreg.c to do 2D registration on 3D+time datasets.
    * Modified mri_align.c, imreg.c, and fim2.c to recognize macro
       ALLOW_DFTIME, if the user wants to compile the ability to
       do -dftime or -dfspacetime registration.

03 Mar 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Allow to3d to create 3D+time FIM datasets.  Allow afni to display
       them as functional overlays.
    * Add -noplugins option to afni, so that it is possible to skip
       plugins initialization (also can setenv AFNI_NOPLUGINS).
    * In to3d.c, if any -[xyz]SLAB or -[xyz]FOV options are used, then
       require that all 3 axes be given if the dataset is to be
       written out correctly without opening the interactive window.

04 Mar 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a 'Read Sess' button to allow input of a new session into
       afni.  Also added a function THD_equiv_files to 3ddata.c to
       allow for checking if 2 filenames are equivalent (point to
       the same inode on the same disk).

05 Mar 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a dummy dataset to afni.c, so that if there are none when
       the user starts, he can read them in with the 'Read Sess' button.
    * Added a 'Read 1D' button to allow input of timeseries files.

10 Mar 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made the 'Selection' box in the new file selectors have the
       'HOTCOLOR' as the background.  This is because of the importance
       of the contents of this box.

20 Mar 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Created script files to compile and distribute AFNI binaries
       on and to various computers.

02 Apr 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Incorporated the CLAMS library into the internal (MCW only) version
       of AFNI.

03 Apr 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Created the 'imcalc' program, analogous to 3dcalc, but for 2D images.

21 Apr 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Started work on 'plug_realtime.c', including the '3T_toafni.c'
       program to extract data from ParaVision and send it into AFNI.

22 Apr 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified registered functions to each have an int flag.  The only
       flag value used now is bit 0 = RETURNS_STRING.  This can be used
       in a 1D function (via PLUTO_register_1D_funcstr) to return an
       extra string that will be displayed in graph's button 3 popup.
    * Modified the LSQfit plugin to return the fit parameters in the
       extra string, so that the user can display them.

17 Jun 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Lots of changes in the last 2 months to make plug_realtime.c work.
    * Added a menu item to afni_graph.c to allow user to control graph
       colors and line thicknesses.  The colors can also be initialized
       from the .Xdefaults file.
    * Added a menu item to afni_graph.c to allow the graph window to
       be dumped to an image file.  Had to fix xim.c to allow for
       the XImage format returned by XGetImage on the graph Pixmap.
    * Modified imseq.c so that if the user types '.pnm' as the end
       of the 'Save:one' filename, the program won't add another
       '.pnm' to the end.

18 Jun 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Had to fix the xim.c routine XImage_to_mri to work correctly
       with 12 bit Visuals.
    * Added stuff so that .Xdefaults can initialize the line thicknesses
       as well as the colors.

25 Jun 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made afni_plugout.c and plugout_tt.c -- initial implementations
       of the 'plugout' concept: programs that talk to AFNI using
       IOCHANs to get T-T coordinates, etc.
    * Modified iochan.c to allow a socket connection to cutoff
       abruptly when closed.  This was needed because I found that
       a socket connection might hang around a while after close,
       and this would prevent new connections on the same port #.
       At present, this capability is only used when afni exits.
    * The plugout code (afni_plugout.c) is an Xt work process.
       To prevent it soaking up too much CPU time, if nothing
       happens, it will sleep for 10 msec.  This work process
       is disabled if the realtime plugin is active.

30 Jun 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine THD_extract_series and macros PLUTO_extract_series*
       to get time series from 3D+time datasets.  [per Ziad Saad]
    * Modified 3ddup.c to allow conversion of 3D+time anatomy into
       3D+time fim.  This will allow the overlay of EPI time series
       as 'function' onto the corresponding anatomy.

02 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified imstat.c to work with 3D image files, at least partly.

16 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made -orient option (and AFNI_ORIENT environment) work to change
       the order in which coordinates are displayed in the afni.c
       crosshair label.

22 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * -orient (and AFNI_ORIENT) now work with 3dclust.c.
    * The 'jump to' popup in afni.c now works with the orientation
       code, so that you can paste coordinates out of 3dclust
       into to jumpto window.

23 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 6 new functional dataset types, with thresholds being
       distributed as follows
              normal    chi-square   incomplete-beta
              binomial  gamma        Poisson
    * Gave user ability to change range of threshold slider -- before,
       range was fixed by threshold functional dataset type.
    * Found problem on Linux (1.2.13) with 'dlopen' loading of plugins
       and models -- seems to have problems at about the 20th library.
       Not sure what to do about this.
    * Added routine PLUTO_report to allow a plugin to report status
       information at startup.

28 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added new utility program '3drefit.c' to allow user to change
       the axes stored in a dataset header.  This is mostly to
       fixup errors that may have occurred at to3d time.
    * Added -orient option to to3d.c (not that it is much use).
    * Fixed bug in 3dinfo.c, for printout of sub-brick scaling
       factors when no statistics are present in the header.

30 Jul 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added ability to include a rotation warp when using 3ddup.
    * Added ability to include empty markers in 3drefit.
    * Fixed AFNI_init_warp (in afni.c) where it give the name
       of the new dataset based on the 'adam' dataset, rather
       than the 'parent'.  This causes problems when transforming
       a dataset that is itself warp-on-demand from 3ddup -- the
       names would be based on the ultimate warp parent, not
       the derived parent from 3ddup.

01 Aug 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a label in the Define Function control panel to show
       the crosshair pixel value, if all 3 image windows are
       open (afni.c, afni_func.c, afni_widg.c).
    * Made Button3+Modifiers work even if CapsLock or NumLock
       is pressed (imseq.c).
    * Added random Shakespearean insults.
    * Added AFNI_SESSTRAIL (3ddata.c) to control session 'lastname'.

22 Aug 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Raoqiong Tong modified parser.f to make the vector evaluation
       routine work again.
    * Also fixed 3dcalc.c to work with 3D+time datasets.

26 Aug 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Oops!  Had to fix the EXP_0D plugin in plug_lsqfit.c because
       the parser vector evaluation routine was changed.

03 Oct 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Oops!!  Fixed a bug in mri_align.c, where the fine fit weight
       image wasn't computed properly.  This affected fim2, imreg,
       and plug_imreg.

22 Oct 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Oops**2.  Fixed a bug in the bug fix above.

27 Oct 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Changed csfft to csfft_cox in all places to avoid conflict
       with code by AJ.

30 Oct 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed DXY_THRESH to PHI_THRESH in one line of mri_align.c
    * Worked on adding popup 'hints' to AFNI.

10 Nov 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added popup hints to to3d.
    * Added 'Clinical' disclaimer to startup message.
    * Remove scale hints (afni.c, imseq.c), since they are particularly
       obnoxious.

12 Nov 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added some SPARKY specific header declarations to fix problems
       with SunOS compiling system (e.g., strtod).

20 Nov 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Increased buffer sizes in count.c
    * Added Makefile.sparc5_2.5 for Suns.

21 Nov 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Allowed brick dimensions to be specified as '120A' or 'A120'
       in to3d.c.  This is to make it consistent with the way
       scanners print on films.

30 Nov 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added the 'bucket' types (anat and func) to 3ddata.h, and
       then modified afni, editvol, etc., to utilize this type
       of dataset.
    * Created program 3dbucket.c to put buckets together out of
       sub-bricks from other datasets.
    * Modified 3drefit.c to allow changes to bucket sub-brick
       information.

09 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a new chooser to let user pick interpolation method
       for threshold (statistical) sub-bricks.
    * Fixed CUBIC_CLIP in afni_warp.c -- it was incorrectly
       placed before the brick_fac scaling, not after.
    * Removed FIM menu from Define Function control panel.

13 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added new file '3dmaker.c', for routines that make new
       3D datasets from other datasets.  Moved the guts of
       the PLUTO_4D_to_typed_* routines into this file.
    * Also fixed a 'float *' inside mallocs to be 'float'
       in a couple of places in these routines.  This should
       be innocuous, since most CPUs satisfy
         sizeof(float) <= sizeof(float *)

15 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'Compute FIM+' to FIM menu.  This saves the best
       time series index in a new sub-brick.
    * Added some macros to editvol.h to make changing sub-brick
       auxiliary values simpler.

17 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified AFNI_set_viewpoint to skip graph redraw unless
       REDISPLAY_ALL or unless a new (x,y,z) location is set.
    * Added menu to the pbar label to allow modification of
       the colors and spacings.
    * Modified display.h to allocate overlay colors from
       read-write cells.  This allows the colors to be
       redefined.

18 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added -noqual option to AFNI to make it skip quality checks
       when doing marker transformations.
    * Added -view option to 3drefit to let it change coordinate
       systems.

21 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added ability to read in palettes and colors from .afnirc file,
       and interactively from a user-specified file.  Also allow
       user to reset the top and spacings on the color pbar.
    * Modified display.[ch] to put all overlay stuff into a shared
       struct for all MCW_DCs.  This means that the -unique option
       will only generate new grayscale colorcells for each controller,
       but they will now share overlay colors.  This is intended to
       prevent a problem when users add new colors dynamically
       from external palette files.  This change affected files
         afni_func.c afni_graph.c afni_graph.h afni_setup.c xim.c
         afni_widg.c bbox.c display.c display.h imseq.c pbar.c
    * Modified pbar.c to keep the input pval's exactly when calling
       alter_MCW_pbar -- formerly, after resizing the panes, the
       values might be altered slightly.
    * Discovered that 17,DEC,97 change to AFNI_set_viewpoint could
       make graph not be drawn correctly on startup.  Added
       'never_drawn' variable to graphs and imseqs to allow
       this condition to be detected.

22 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Removed auto-change of threshold scale for bucket datasets
       from afni.c.  Also unmanages/remanages this scale when
       the pbar is being changed, due to horrible visual effects
       on the SGI machine nimloth (if FIX_SCALE_SIZE_PROBLEM
       is defined).
    * Modified pbar.c to store the summed pane heights, and then
       recompute the value/label only when such a summed height
       changes.  This prevents the modification of the value/label
       pairs at other panes when resizing only one pane.
    * Modified AFNI_bucket_label_CB (afni_func.c) to put the
       sub-brick index at the left of the option menu label.

26 Dec 1997, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in palette write-out (afni_setup.c).
    * Added a scrollable text output utility (xutil.c).  Made
       the plugin help use it if the help string has many
       lines (afni_plugin.c).  Added a line counting routine
       to 3ddata.c

02 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added ability to read compressed .BRIK files to 3ddata.c
       (gzip -d, bzip2 -d, and uncompress are supported).
    * Added program '3dnoise' to zero out noise-like regions
       of nonnegative short datasets.
    * Modified display of dataset names to include number of
       points in a 3D+t dataset, and to include a 'z' flag
       to indicate compression of dataset.

05 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'New Stuff' entry to Misc menu, which just pops up
       the README.changes file into a readonly text window.
    * Program 'quotize.c' will take a text file and make it
       into a C array of strings, one line per element.  This
       is used in afni_func.c to popup the README.changes file,
       which is put into the file 'newstuff.hhh' by quotize and
       in the Makefile.INCLUDE.

07 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a routine to editvol.c to do local averaging of a
       dataset faster than -1filter_mean -- it seems to run
       about 6 times faster.  This is implemented as
       -1filter_aver in 3dmerge, so that the older one is
       still available.  Also modified plug_edit.c to add
       this option to the Filter menu.

08 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified scaling for output of 3dmerge.c so that the program
       detects if all the inputs are integer types (byte or short,
       unscaled).  If they are, and the merger type is consistent
       with integer type, then the output will be unscaled, otherwise
       it will be scaled by a float.

09 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_graph.[ch] to allow choice of a timeseries to
       be used to define the x-axis graphing.  Thus, if x(t) is
       the x-axis timeseries, and yij(t) are the data timeseries,
       then each graph ij now shows x(t) vs. yij(t) rather than
       t vs. yij(t).
    * Also modified the Button 1 press in the central graph to
       jump to the time index point whose graph point is closest
       to the button click.
    * Also allowed data plots to be shown as points instead of
       lines.  'Points' are drawn using the '_circle' routine
       ('filled' or 'hollow', as the line is 'thick' or 'thin').

12 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Allow a gap between the sub-graph boxes.  This is chosen
       from the 'Colors etc.' menu.
    * Raoqiong Tong fixed a bug in the new parser.f with the
       AND, OR, and MOFN functions.

14 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified symbol for current time index in afni_graph.c, so
       that when data is graphed with points the current point
       can be distinguished from the graph points.

16 Jan 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'Percent Change' calculation to afni_fimmer.c, and
       removed the 'real-time' update feature from those routines.

01 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3ddata.c to avoid use of 'scandir' routine, which caused
       no end of trouble on Solaris.
    * Moved the 'mcw_glob' routines into libmri.a.  These are used to
       get filenames from the directory now.

02 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a typo in plug_imreg.c to make the 'Fine Blur' parameter
       scale to FWHM properly.
    * Broke 3ddata.c into 'thd_*.c' routines, and incorporated them
       into libmri.a.  Also incorporated 3dmaker.c and iochan.c.
       Files 3ddata.c, 3dmaker.[ch], and iochan.[ch] are no more!

03 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Also put editvol.c into 'edt_*.c' routines, and thence into
       librmi.a
    * Added an 'Autoscale' button to graph Opt menu, and also execute
       the autoscale code when the graph is 1st drawn.

04 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified dbtrace.h to enable tracing with usual afni run.  This
       can be turned on/off using the 'Misc' menu, or the '-trace'
       option (if the program is compiled with USE_TRACING).

08 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_graph.c to display dataset indices in graph window,
       rather than FD_brick indices.  (See the DONT_MANGLE_XYZ location.)
    * Modified imseq.[ch], afni_graph.[ch], afni.[ch], and the new
       file afni_receive.c to allow transmission of mouse Button2
       data to a calling routine.  Work is in progress -- more later.

13 Feb 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Released drawing plugin to MCW users.  Includes open and closed
       curves, filling, and undo.
    * Also added .BRIK output compression to thd_compress.[ch], and to
       thd_writedblk.c.

16 Mar 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added internal globbing to 'afni -im'.
    * Modified function AFNI_follower_dataset (afni_func.c) to copy
       datablock auxiliary data from the data parent, if available.
    * Modified 3drefit.c to allow -fbuc and -abuc to work no matter
       how many sub-bricks are present.
    * Added program 3dmaskave.c to print out averages from dataset
       sub-bricks, with ROI selected by a mask.

18 Mar 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Made 'ptr' a byte variable rather than char in XImage_to_mri
       (xim.c) -- this seems to fix a problem on some machines.

20 Mar 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed EDIT_add_bricklist -- the brick auxiliary data additions
       would free data that hadn't been allocated.
    * Modified stuff so that Dummy dataset is not deleted -- this
       seems to help.  (It only takes up 64K, so the loss is small.)

21 Mar 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3dmaskave to allow dumping of all voxels hit by the
       mask, and to compute the standard deviation also.

24 Mar 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified plug_copy.c to allow creation of a 1 sub-brick zero-filled
       'copy' -- useful for making mask datasets.
    * Modified 3dnoise.c for 3D+time datasets, so that a voxel is zeroed
       only if a majority of time points at that location fall below
       the cutoff.
    * Modified plug_drawdset.c to recompute statistics after each edit,
       no matter what.  Also changed the help message a little.
    * Wrote plug_maskave.c to do pretty much the same thing as 3dmaskave.c.

17 Apr 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3dcalc.c to allow input of *.1D time series
       in place of datasets.

25 Apr 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_*.c to store byte order (for short and int dsets) in the
       .HEAD file.  Then when the file is read in, it will be byte swapped
       if necessary (which will force it to be malloc-ed, not mmap-ed).
    * Also modified 3drefit to allow a byte order to be written to .HEAD
       files.  Note that this does not affect the .BRIK file.
    * Added new environment variable AFNI_BYTEORDER to control byte order
       of output datasets.  This can be 'LSB_FIRST' or 'MSB_FIRST'.  If not
       present, this means to use the native order of the CPU.
    * Added environment variable 'AFNI_NOMMAP' to allow suppression of mmap.
       If the value is 'YES', then all datasets will be malloc-ed.
    * Modified the 'Purge Memory' button to purge ALL datasets from memory.
       Formerly, it only purged the unused ones.

29 Apr 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * At the behest of Ted DeYoe, modified 3dcalc.c to allow operations
       on bucket and other multi-brick datasets that aren't 3D+time.
    * Also modified 3drefit.c to allow conversion of 3D+time into a bucket.
    * This also required the ability to erase datablock attributes, since
       they are persistent -- even if the data in the dataset is voided,
       the attribute will remain to be written to disk.  So a routine
       THD_erase_one_atr was added.  In files thd_writedset.c and
       thd_writdblk.c, every attribute that DOESN'T get written now gets
       erased.  This will still leave extra attributes (perhaps added by
       a plugin) being persistent, but avoids attribute 'hangover' problem.

30 Apr 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3dcalc.c to purge dset sub-bricks when finished with them,
       and to allocate output buffer sub-bricks only when needed.  This is
       to keep memory usage down when using compressed 3D+time datasets.
    * Also added the -verbose option to 3dcalc.c.

01 May 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed plug_rename.c to work with compressed datasets.  Added a
       routine COMPRESS_add_suffix to thd_compress.c to facilitate this.

04 May 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine THD_purge_one_brick to thd_purgedblk.c, to allow
       freeing of one sub-brick from a malloc-ed dataset.  Also
       defined macro DSET_unload_one(dset,iv).

03 Jun 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified AFNI_make_descendants to allow descendancy to flow
       from +acpc datasets, not just from +orig datasets.
       However, this doesn't work just yet, due to warping issues.

05 Jun 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3dnoise.c to have option to set noise level on command
       line, rather than compute it.

09 Jun 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified edt_clust*.c routines to implement -1clust_order option.
    * Modified 3drefit.c to have -nowarp option.

13 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Incorporated Doug Ward's erosion+dilation routines into the
       clustering modules.

14 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added option -skip_afnirc to allow .afnirc file to be skipped.
    * Fixed bug in afni_setup.c that didn't manage the palette chooser
       menu when starting with 0 palettes and then later reading in some.
    * Fixed bug in plug_copy.c that put the anat type off by 1.  Also
       made the 'Zero [One]' option not make the anat type always be omri.
    * Fixed bug in parser.f, whereby the vector versions of the boolean
       functions (or, and, mofn) were evaluated incorrectly.

15 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Change afni_pcor.c to remove use of DENEPS test for division
       in computation of correlation coefficient.

17 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program imstack.c to stack up a bunch of 2D images into
       the stupid MGH format.  [For Kathleen Marie Donahue.]

21 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added model_convgamma.c to represent a gamma variate convolved
       with a reference time series.  The 'k' parameter of Doug Ward's
       model_gammaver.c was modified to be called 'amp' here, since the
       impulse response is reparameterized to have peak value = 'amp',
       rather than 'k * (rb/e)**r', which is clumsy.
    * Modified Doug Ward's NLfit_model.h to ensure that certain routines
       needed by model functions can be forced to be loaded.
    * Modified 3dTSgen.c to make the '-ncnstr' and '-scnstr' options
       recognized, since there is a typo in the manual.
    * Modified Makefile.INCLUDE for 3dTSgen and 3dNLfim to use the
       proper dynamic linking load flags $(PLFLAGS), and also to include
       the proper dependencies.

22 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine THD_timeof_vox to thd_timeof.c.  This allows
       computation of voxel time from voxel index, rather than voxel
       coordinate.
    * Removed some redundant code from 3dTSgen.c -- it opened the
       input dataset twice in a row, and loaded the datablock when
       there was no need.
    * Modified 3dTSgen.c, 3dNLfim.c, and plug_nlfit.c to have new '-inTR'
       option to allow computation of model functions with TR set from
       the input dataset rather than fixed at TR=1.  Note that if the
       units of the dataset time axis are msec, they will be converted
       to sec instead (allowing msec to be used as a unit was a mistake).

27 Jul 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in routine suck_file in afni_setup.c, which put the
       terminating NUL character 1 place too far in the output array.
    * Wrote program uncomment.c, to remove comments from C files.
    * Added model_convgamma2a.c.
    * Modified NLfit.c to generate a fixed set of random samples instead
       of starting over for each voxel.  Also fixed the algorithm that
       keeps the best random samples -- it was not always keeping the
       best one, just some of them.

01 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added copyright information to some .c and .h files.
    * Modified mri_to_short.c to allow for special case of scale!=1.0.
    * Modified plug_realtime.c to allow for 2D image alignment.
       (Continuation of work from,APR,that was unfinished then.)
       First cut is to do all registration at end of acquisition.
    * Turned off 'frivolities' during a real-time run.
    * Added the ability to graph points+lines together in afni_graph.c
       (also see changes of 09,JAN,1998).

06 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added changes to thd_compress.[ch] made by Craig Stark/Paul Reber
       of UCSD, to allow them to use their custom decompression
       program 'brikcomp'.
    * Added realtime 2D registration to plug_realtime.c.
    * Modified 3dmaskave.c and plug_maskave.c to allow user to choose
       a sub-brick of the mask dataset.  plug_maskave.c also now lets
       the user save the mask average of a 3D+time dataset into the
       timeseries library (for use as a FIM, for example).  Also
       fixed an overflow bug in both programs when the mask range
       is too big for a short or byte dataset.

07 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified display.[ch] to store extra information about the X11
       visual.  This isn't used yet, but is preparatory to allowing
       support for using TrueColor visuals and installed colormaps.

17 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Adapted old Fortran PLOTPAK to in-memory plotting, with routines
       to graph to screen and to PostScript.
    * Used this to implement the 'Plot' button in the timeseries chooser,
       and to do graphing of the realtime 2D motion parameters.

22 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified display.c to support TrueColor visuals, and xim.c to
       support arbitrary byte ordering, plus 3 and 4 bytes/pixel.

23 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified dbtrace.h and most afni_*.c files to allow not only
       debug tracing of routine entry/exit, but also the printout
       of other debugging information that was formerly hidden
       behind '#ifdef AFNI_DEBUG'.
    * A few more changes to make xim.c work properly with depth=24,
       which can be either 3 or 4 bytes/pixel.

25 Aug 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_pcor.c change of 15,JUL,1998 to check denominator
       vs. DENEPS rather than 0.0.

09 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_sarr.c to add routine to 'normalize' a list of
       files using the C library routine 'realpath' and to cast out
       duplicate files.
    * Used this in afni.c and thd_get1D.c.
    * Also added *.1Dv files to list of allowable 1D extensions in
       thd_get1D.c.
    * Doug Ward provided me with the new 3dDeconvolve.c program, as
       well as some changes to 2dImReg and 3dRegAna.

14 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added '-install' option to afni.c to allow installation of a
       new X11 Colormap.  Also affected display.[ch], afni_widg.c,
       imseq.c, afni_graph.c, xutil.[ch], afni_plugin.c, to3d.c,
       and plug_drawdset.c.
    * Added '-2swap' and '-4swap' options to to3d.c, to allow data
       to be byte-swapped on input.  Also added a 'Byte Swap' button
       to do the same thing interactively.

16 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    Older History stuff

    * Added '-1zscore' option to 3dmerge.c (via edt_onedset.c, etc.).
    * Also completed the list of 'p2t' and 't2p' routines, as well
       as adding 't2z' routines, in mri_stats.c and thd_statpval.c.

18 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program cdf.c to provide a command line way to get results
       from the 't2p', 'p2t', and 't2z' routines.
    * Modified afni_setup.c so that when a .pal file is input, the
       last newly defined palette becomes the active one in the
       AFNI controller which read the file in.

22 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program 3dTcat.c, to catenate multiple 3D+time datasets into
       one big dataset (and possibly detrend them at the same time).
       This was adapted from 3dbucket.c

28 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified edt_onedset.c to correctly deal with clipping a dataset
       when the clip range is larger than the dataset range, and the
       datum type is short.

29 Sep 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine mri_rota_shear() to mri_rota.c to do 2D image rotation
       using the Paeth shearing method combined with FFTs.

01 Oct 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_rota_shear to double up on FFTs -- speeds it up by
       about 30%.
    * Modified mri_align.c and mri_2dalign.c to allow choice of
       interpolation method at each stage of registration.
    * Modified imrotate.c, imreg.c, and plug_realtime.c to use the new
       image alignment methods.

09 Oct 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni.c and thd_fdbrick.c to allow the user to control the
       image flipping -- that is, to let left be displayed on the left.

16 Oct 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Released 3dvolreg.c to Tom Ross for beta testing.

21 Oct 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routines to afni_plugin.c to create/manipulate PLUGIN_strval's
       [= label + textfield].

26 Oct 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Finished plug_tag.c, and added tagset to a 3D dset.  Modified afni.c
       to allow markers panel to open when there are no markers, so user can
       control the color of the tags.
    * Modified mri_max.c to fix the initial values.
    * Modified 3dvolreg.c and mri_3dalign.c to add a clipping option.

01 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added realtime 3D registration to plug_realtime.c.
    * Added quintic interpolation option to thd_rot3d.c and places that use
       it (3dvolreg.c, mri_3dalign.c, 3drotate.c, and plug_realtime.c).

03 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni.c, afni_widg.c, and afni.h to allow user to lock time
       indexes of controllers, as well as the spatial locations.

12 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified 3dmerge.c to have new -1dindex and -1tindex options.

16 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_align.c, mri_2dalign.c, and mri_3dalign.c to ensure
       that the weighting factors are non-negative.
    * Modified 3dvolreg.c to skip registration on the base volume.
    * Added plug_volreg.c to do the same job as 3dvolreg.c.
    * Fixed bug in 3drotate.c that caused -[ab]shift commands without
       directional suffixes to be converted into zeros.

18 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in plug_power.c in the untangling of FFT coefficients.
    * Modified afni_slice.c to properly clip short and byte interpolation
       to avoid overflow.

20 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified csfft.c to use unrolled routines for FFTs of length 16,
       32, and 64.  Also added special routines using the fft64 code
       to do lengths 128 and 256.
    * Modified mri_3dalign.c and 3dvolreg.c to allow specification of
       a different interpolation method to be used at the final
       rotation to the output brick.

23 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a typo in plug_realtime.c and plug_volreg.c that made the
       choice of 'Heptic' use quintic interpolation instead.

27 Nov 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed some logical errors in 3dmerge.c with interaction of -1dindex,
       -1doall, and the dataset I/O.

03 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a problem in 3dmerge.c with '-datum float' and the sub-brick
       scaling factor, when editing one dataset only.

04 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added unrolled fft8() to csfft.c.
    * Modified thd_rot3d.c to start the FFT size calculation at least
       at 95% of the actual width rather than 90%.  This reduces the
       likelihood of wraparound effects.

10 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a timeout for the child process in plug_realtime.c.

13 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in the dataset -> time series routines that didn't
       scale properly if some of the brick factors were zero and
       others were not.  Files affected: mri_to_float.c, thd_dsetto1D.c,
       thd_fdto1D.c, and thd_initdblk.c.

16 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Removed TESTER code from afni_widg.c, and added some STATUS()
       printouts to trace progress.

17 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified xutil.c to use XmChangeColor to change the color
       of a widget (routine MCW_set_widget_bg).
    * Added some changes by Doug Ward to speed up linear regression
       calculations.

22 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in plug_volreg.c, where the ax? variables were used
       before they were defined, resulting in the wrong order of output
       of the estimated movement parameters in the graphs and dfile.

30 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added function Winsor9 to the 2D transformations, in imseq.c.
    * Added RowGraphs to imseq.c, also affecting plot_ts.c (in coxplot)
       and afni.c.

31 Dec 1998, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni.c crosshairs to allow display only along certain axes.

03 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added routine MCW_widget_visible to xutil.c, and used it in imseq.c
       and afni_graph.c.

04 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed the time lock feature in afni.c so that it would not operate
       if toggled off.  [Oops]
    * Added AFNI_ALWAYS_LOCK environment feature.

05 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified the way imseq.c places the dialogs (Disp and Mont buttons),
       so as to reduce the likelihood that some of the dialog will appear
       offscreen.
    * Added HorZ ('h') selection to afni_graph.c 'Opt->Grid' submenu, which
       will draw a dashed line at the y=0 level in each sub-graph.

06 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_graph.c to try to avoid crashes when graphing window
       is closed using 'Opt' menu 'Done' button.  Seems to be caused
       by Expose events, but what exactly isn't clear -- happens on
       SGI systems.  Using the 'Done' button now starts a 50 msec timeout
       before the 'q' key is simulated.  Also, the Expose event count
       is now checked before processing, and only if event->count == 0
       is any work done.  Why these changes do the job is not obvious.

07 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_graph.c to move placement on screen of the
       'Opt->Colors Etc.' submenu if it ends up placed directly over
       the 'Opt' menu.  This could happen on some versions of Motif
       when the graph window is up against the right edge of the
       screen.  A callback is executed when the submenu is mapped,
       and if it is in a bad location, its XmNx value is changed.

10 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified edt_coerce.c to make EDIT_coerce_type work with doubles.

11 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified the rest of edt_coerce.c and edt_volamax.c to allow doubles.
    * Added thd_mastery.c, which allows a dataset to be 'mastered' on input,
       so that its bricks are a selection of bricks from a master dataset.
       Adds the routine THD_open_dataset().  Modified 3ddata.h and a
       bunch of other functions.
    * Modified 3dinfo.c, 3dcalc.c, rtfeedme.c, from3d.c, 3drotate.c, and
       3dvolreg.c, to use the new opening routine, to allow for subset
       selection.

15 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed the old 3dpc.c to work with the new AFNI data storage,
       and to use the EISPACK routines instead of LAPACK (with help
       from Vinai Roopchansingh).
    * Made swap4 work with float input datasets as well as int.

19 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added '-1ddum' argument to 3dpc.c.

20 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in mri_stats.c, where 'p2t' conversion was done backwards
       for the F statistic (p should have been q, and vice-versa).

21 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added SurfGraph feature to imseq.c.
    * Added OSfilt9 to imseq.c and the 2D transformations menu (afni.c).
    * Modified coxplot/plot_topshell.c to store a handle to the form at top
       of the graph window hierarchy.
    * Modified xutil.c to add the 'SaveUnder' property to the hints widget.

24 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified coxplot (coxplot.h, plot_motif.c, plot_x11.c) to use the
       X11 Double Buffer extension, if HAVE_XDBE is defined.  This makes
       the redrawing of graphs look much smoother.

25 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Created the 'AREN' routines (aren.[ch]) for volume rendering, on top
       of VolPack.  Not sure what to do with them yet.

26 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in initialization and usage of Xdbe library, in coxplot.

27 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Add 'UK Flag' location marker to RowGraphs and SurfGraphs.

29 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed afni_func.c so that if the user presses 'See Function'
       when there is no function, it turns the toggle button back
       off.  Formerly, it turned off the internal flag, but didn't
       change the toggle button state, so that the user was fooled.

30 Jan 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'Flood->Zero' and 'Zero->Value' options to plug_drawdset.c.

05 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added plug_render.c, the first version (grayscale only) of the
       volume rendering code.
    * Changed name of AREN to MREN and put it in mri_render.[ch].
    * Cloned the mcw_graf.[ch] routines out of xv.
    * Added the coordinate stuff to 3dcalc.c.

    Older History stuff

    * Added new program 3dfractionize.c (per Ziad Saad).

09 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Changes to imseq.c include putting the colorbar popup menu on
       ctrl-Button3 if there is only 1 image in the sequence, and
       changing the sharp-factor arrowval to run from 1-9 instead
       of 1-99.
    * Added 'MCW_noactext' option to arrowvals (bbox.c), so that
       the usual actions taken when the user leaves the window
       are not taken.
    * Added many features to plug_render.c: automation, cutouts,
       and accumulation.
    * Fixed 3drefit.c -view option.

10 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added 'Expr > 0' cutout to plug_render.c
    * Added SIND(), COSD(), and TAND() functions to parser.f

11 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified many routines in mri_*.c to deal with MRI_rgb type
       images, in preparation for modifying imseq.c to deal with such.
    * Modified display.[ch] to include a 'colordef' for conversion
       between Pixel and RGB triples.
    * Added routine to xim.c to convert MRI_rgb image to an XImage.
    * Changed imseq.c to allow MRI_rgb images.
    * Created program 1dplot.c.

15 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_render.c to change the way it deals with color volumes.
    * Modified plug_render.c to allow for color overlays.
    * Modified xim.c and display.c to deal with converting a RGB image
       to an XImage in a more efficient way.

16 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified bbox.[ch] to allow non-power-of-10 steps in an arrowval,
       if the av->fstep structure component is modified by the user.
    * Some minor cosmetic changes to plug_render.c.

    Older History stuff

    * In plug_render.c
      + Replaced 'Remove Isolas' w/ 'Remove Small Clusters' in plug_render.c
      + Added the slant cut planes.
    * In imseq.c, made it so that closing a rowgraph or surfgraph window
       turns off the feature.

22 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * New routine 'addto_args' (addto_args.c) used to catenate stdin
       to the (argc,argv) command line of a program.  Testbed is
       3dRegAna.c (for D. Emge).
    * Added 'LOCK_ZORDER' command to plug_realtime (for Vinai).
    * Fixed bugs in plug_render.c having to do with the 'Expr > 0' cutout
      + Combination with AND was incorrect (counted ncdone too many times);
      + Test for evaluation to a pure number was incorrect if there were
        any leading blanks.

23 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed a bug in thd_trusthost.c.

25 Feb 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added the MEDIAN function to parser.f and 3dcalc.c.

01 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added the *_p2t, *_t2p, and *_t2z functions to parser.f, parser_int.c,
        and 3dcalc.c.
    * Created ASCII PPM file gmove.ppmap to use in gmovie csh script.
    * Removed tapering from FFT interpolation in thd_rot3d.c.

03 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_sarr.c to skip the realpath() expansion if the
       environment variable AFNI_NOREALPATH is set.

06 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Removed GNU malloc from afni.c and incorporated my own mcw_malloc.[ch]
       functions/macros.

08 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * More changes to mcw_malloc.[ch].
    * Added macro FREE_AV() to bbox.h, because I found out that all places
       where I used XtFree() on an arrowval would leave the string values
       (sval) high and dry.

09 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * In refit_MCW_optmenu (bbox.c), found I had to free the av->sval and
       ->old_sval values, since they were being abandoned.
    * Added AFNI_NO_MCW_MALLOC environment variable to mcw_malloc.c,
       to let user turn off these routines.

10 Mar 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * In afni_graph.c, added deletion of XImage after XGetImage
       is used to save the graph window to a file.

    Older History stuff

    * Fixed 2 bugs in plug_render.c
       - opacity_scale changed wasn't checked if number of cutouts == 0
       - didn't invalidate overlay when loading new functional dataset

    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni_receive.c to allow for new types of transmission
       DRAWNOTICE = notification that something was drawn
       DSETCHANGE = notification that dataset pointers may have changed
                    (needed when rescanning sessions)
    * afni_receive.c now handles transmission to all the interested
       viewers using the AFNI_process_* routines within.
    * Modified plug_drawdset.c to properly recover when rescan is used.
    * Modified plug_render.c to redraw when DRAWNOTICE is received,
       and to recover when rescan is used.
    * Modified 3dcalc.c to scale each output sub-brick to shorts/bytes
       separately, rather than globally [per request of KMD].

01 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Finally centralized the computation of the '[A]' type labels for
       AFNI controllers in afni_func.c, in the new routine
       AFNI_controller_label(im3d).  Then modified afni_plugin.c,
       afni_widg.c, plug_render.c, plug_drawdset.c, and plug_tag.c
       to use this function.

02 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_http.c to use directory $TMPDIR if defined, rather
       than always rely on /tmp.
    * Also added routines to this file to allow transfer of 'ftp://'
       URLs -- this is done using a shell script running the
       ftp program.

03 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified plug_render.c to have the currently active dataset
       'selected' when the user popups a new dataset chooser.
    * Removed the non-working rotation feature from 3ddup.c.

05 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_http.c to allow change of user ident for ftp://
       access to files.
    * Tested AFNI with LessTif v.0.89 -- seems to work.

13 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_read.c to allow 3D: hglobal to be < -1 as
       long as hglobal+himage >= 0 [per Gary Strangman of MGH].
    * Added mri_cut.c, function to cut out a sub-image.

14 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni.c to fix the pbar_sgn_* initialization, since
       it incorrectly checked the thresholds against the range
       0..1 rather than -1..1 [per Chad Moritz of UW Madison].

15 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified mri_read.c to also try ppm from mri_read() function.
    * Modified mri_write.c to write byte files as pgm.
    * Modified mri_to_rgb.c to have a 1 rgb image -> 3 byte image function,
       and fixed a bug in the 3 images -> 1 rgb image function.
    * Added mri_dup.c, to upsample a 2D image; added program imupsam.c
       to do this function from the command line.

19 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified afni.c, afni.h, afni_widg.c to add 'Set All' button

26 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed thd_info.c to report dataset axes dimensions correctly
       (also fixed DAXES_NUM macro in 3ddata.h).
    * Put code in plug_render.c that allows non-axial datasets to
       be rendered -- but disabled it for now.
    * New program 3daxialize.c will rewrite a dataset with BRIKs
       into the RAI (axial) orientation.

28 Apr 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * In 3daxialize.c, made sure that the slice-wise time offsets
       are nulled out.

27 May 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added an X defaults initializer for the graph ggap.

30 May 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added a variable polort order to afni.c, afni.h, afni_graph.c,
       and afni_fimmer.c.
    * Discovered a bug in afni_pcor.c in the % Change calculation,
       where the last ort wasn't being used in the baseline estimation.

02 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified plug_render.c to draw partial crosshair sets like the
       image viewers.
    * Modified afni.c to send a 'process viewpoint' message when the
       partial crosshair status changes, so that the renderer will
       get a notice and be able to redraw itself promptly.
    * Modified plug_realtime.c to use polort.
    * Added ability to change FIM background threshold percent (FIM_THR)
       to afni_graph.[ch], afni.c, afni_fimmer.c, and plug_realtime.c

03 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed thd_info.c where it referred to brick labels that might not
       exist -- now it uses the DSET_BRICK_LAB macro, which always works.
    * Fixed plug_realtime.c to add brick labels to the FIM dataset.

04 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

       afni_setup.c, and to afni.c to have environment variables setup
       before other things.
    * Made AFNI_load_defaults() in afni.c look at environment variable
       AFNI_name if X11 resource AFNI*name doesn't exist.

07 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in edt_onedset.c that always applied zscore transformation
       if possible!
    * Created afni_environ.[ch], which now process a ***ENVIRONMENT section
       of .afnirc.  Also, in all programs, switched use of getenv() to
       my_getenv(), which just makes sure that .afnirc's ***ENVIRONMENT has
       been processed before using getenv().  In this way, the .afnirc setup
       will be universal.

08 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added MCW_new_idcode() to 3drotate.c -- was producing datasets with
       identical idcodes, which is terrible!
    * Added function THD_check_idcodes() [thd_checkidc.c] to allow AFNI to
       check the idcodes in all datasets for duplicates.

15 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed afni_receive.c to return the proper 'key' value from function
        AFNI_receive_init().
    * Modified plug_render.c to redisplay func dataset statistics after
        receiving a drawing notice.
    * Modified afni_plugin.[ch] to crosscheck each plugin's compilation
        date with AFNI's, and print a warning if they differ.

17 Jun 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program 24swap.c.

07 Jul 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

       Also modified mcw_graf.[ch].

19 Jul 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed bug in 3dcalc.c, where it tested CALC_type[ids] for > 0, whereas
       it should have been >= 0.  The effect was that 3D+time byte valued
       datasets were not loaded into the atoz array.

29 Jul 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Fixed afni_graph.c to not use XComposeStatus in XLookupString call,
       which was causing trouble on SunOS.
    * Line 2707 of afni_graph.c had an '==' for assignment, instead of '='.
       The effect was a possible failure of the x-axis (xax_tsim) graphing
       mode.  I don't think this failure ever occurred in practice.

30 Jul 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program float_scan.c and function thd_floatscan.c to check
       floating point files and arrays (respectively) for illegal values
       (e.g., NaN and Infinity).  Incorporated thd_floatscan() into
       thd_loaddblk.c (if AFNI_FLOATSCAN is set).

       which determines the order in which the plugins appear on the menu.
    * Received 4 plugins (plug_hemisub, plug_maskcalc, plug_roiedit,
        plug_maxima) from the estate of Rick Reynolds.

    Older History stuff

    * Added a '[left is left]' or '[left is right]' label to the winfo text
       in AFNI coronal and axial images displays.  Affected files
       imseq.[ch], afni.c.

    Older History stuff

    * Modified count.c to accept a '-scale' option.
    * Modified Tom Ross's 3dNotes.c software to be a set of routines (thd_note

       be more verbose (Bharat Biswal couldn't understand one).
    * Modified afni_fimmer.c (and afni.h, afni_graph.c) to allow computation
       of '% From Ave' = percent change computed from the average instead
       of from the baseline [per AJ].

11 Sep 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)

    s
       '{assumed}' next to the reported byte order.
    * Added hostname to History Note time stamp, so you can see what on what
       machine a program was run.

20 Sep 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * thd_initdblk.c: print out a warning if byte order is unspecified when
       creating a dataset.

    Older History stuff

    * Modified plug_histog.c and afni_plugin.[ch] to plot extra curves
       in histograms.
    * Modified coxplot/plot_motif.c to look harder for the HOTCOLOR before
       it gives up and uses the default.

07 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_makemask.c to include a counting function.
    * Modified plug_histog.c to use THD_makemask() rather than create
       its own mask the hard way (I just forgot about that routine).
    * Added program 1deval.c, to evaluate an expression at a bunch
       of points and write it to disk - the goal is to simplify
       creation of sample 1D files.

08 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Increased buffer size in mri_read.c for ASCII file line length.

09 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added AFNI_ENFORCE_ASPECT environment variable, to make imseq.c
       enforce the image aspect ratio - this is to be used when the
       window manager doesn't do this properly.

13 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added program 3dTstat.c to compute the same stuff that plug_stats.c

14 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    Older History stuff

    * Added history copy to afni_func.c's creation of follower datasets.
    * Added -preserve option to 3dfractionize.c, to allow the output dataset
       to keep the input values, rather than create a fractional mask.

    Older History stuff

    * Added program 1dtranspose.c.
    * Added option -noijk to 3dmaskdump.c.
    * Added option -tim to afni.c - also modified afni.h, afni_graph.[ch], and
       afni_func.c to make it work.  This option is like -im, but interprets
       the images as being spread thru time rather than space.

20 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified -tim in afni.c to allow for 3D inputs (space-then-time=-zim,

       of csfft_nextup(), for efficiency.
    * Moved shifting routines from thd_rot3d.c to thd_shift2.c, so that
       they can be used in other programs.

29 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Added thd_1Dtodset.c - provides the inverse of thd_dsetto1D.c
       (inserts a vector into a dataset time series, rather than extracts it).
    * Add thd_detrend.c - detrend a timeseries and provide mean, slope.

30 Oct 1999, RW Cox, Miscellaneous, level 1 (MICRO), type 0 (GENERAL)
    Older History stuff

    * Modified thd_detrend.c to have linear and quadratic detrending,
       and an L2 normalizing function.
