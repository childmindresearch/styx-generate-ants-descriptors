[7m*+ WARNING:[0m This program (3daxialize) is old, not maintained, and probably useless!
Usage: 3daxialize [options] dataset
Purpose: Read in a dataset and write it out as a new dataset
         with the data brick oriented as axial slices.
         The input dataset must have a .BRIK file.
         One application is to create a dataset that can
         be used with the AFNI volume rendering plugin.

Options:
 -prefix ppp  = Use 'ppp' as the prefix for the new dataset.
               [default = 'axialize']
 -verb        = Print out a progress report.

The following options determine the order/orientation
in which the slices will be written to the dataset:
 -sagittal    = Do sagittal slice order [-orient ASL]
 -coronal     = Do coronal slice order  [-orient RSA]
 -axial       = Do axial slice order    [-orient RAI]
                 This is the default AFNI axial order, and
                 is the one currently required by the
                 volume rendering plugin; this is also
                 the default orientation output by this
                 program (hence the program's name).

 -orient code = Orientation code for output.
                The code must be 3 letters, one each from the
                pairs {R,L} {A,P} {I,S}.  The first letter gives
                the orientation of the x-axis, the second the
                orientation of the y-axis, the third the z-axis:
                 R = Right-to-left         L = Left-to-right
                 A = Anterior-to-posterior P = Posterior-to-anterior
                 I = Inferior-to-superior  S = Superior-to-inferior
                If you give an illegal code (e.g., 'LPR'), then
                the program will print a message and stop.
          N.B.: 'Neurological order' is -orient LPI
 -frugal      = Write out data as it is rotated, a sub-brick at
                a time. This saves a little memory and was the
                previous behavior.
                Note the frugal option is not available with NIFTI
                datasets

INPUT DATASET NAMES
-------------------
This program accepts datasets that are modified on input according to the
following schemes:
  'r1+orig[3..5]'                                    {sub-brick selector}
  'r1+orig<100..200>'                                {sub-range selector}
  'r1+orig[3..5]<100..200>'                          {both selectors}
  '3dcalc( -a r1+orig -b r2+orig -expr 0.5*(a+b) )'  {calculation}
For the gruesome details, see the output of 'afni -help'.
