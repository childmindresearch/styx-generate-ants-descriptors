Usage: uniq_images fileA fileB ...

* Simple program to read in a list of image filenames,
  determine which files have unique images inside, and
  echo out only a list of the filenames with unique images.
* This program is meant for use in scripts that deal with DICOM
  servers that sometimes deal out multiple copies of the same
  image in different filenames :-(
