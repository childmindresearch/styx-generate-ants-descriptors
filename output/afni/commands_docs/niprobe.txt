   Here's hoping these excerpts from '/opt/afni/src/../install/niprobe -help' enlighten:
        '-dup: Duplicate the element before showing it.'
        '-match MATCH: If MATCH is exact, then attribute name'
        '-quiet: quiet stderr messages, and don't echo attribute'

   Usage: niprobe [-dup] [-nodata] streamspec

A program based on niccc which could bear no more modifications
This program is also for conducting certain NIML tests and checking
the content of niml files and streams.
Examples:
    niprobe -find_nel_named histogram -f h.mean.20_mm-G-SK04.niml.hist \
               | 1dplot -sepscl -stdin 
    niprobe -find_nel_named histogram -f h.mean.20_mm-G-SK04.niml.hist \
               | niprobe -attribute window 'stdin:' 
    niprobe -find_nel_named AFNI_labeltable -f lh.OccROIs.niml.dset

Mandatory arguments:
   streamspec: A string defining a NIML stream.

Options:
   -dup: Duplicate the element before showing it.
         This is to test NI_duplicate function.
   -nodata: Show header parts only in output
   -attribute ATTR: Dump the value of attribute ATTR
   -match MATCH: If MATCH is exact, then attribute name
                 is matched exactly. If MATCH is partial,
                 then a match of all the characters in ATTR
                 is enough. For example, an ATTR of COEF would
                 match any of COEF COEF.1 COEF.2, etc.
            Default is -match exact
   -f: streamspec is a filename (last option on the command line)
   -s: streamspec is an element string like: 
            '<T font=9 coords="2.3 23 2"/>'
            (last option on the command line)
   -stdout: write elements to stdout (default), instead of stderr
   -stderr: write elements to stderr, instead of stdout
   -#: put the # at the beginning of lines with no data (default)
   -No#: Do not put the # at the beginning of lines with no data 
   -quiet: quiet stderr messages, and don't echo attribute
           name with -attribute option
   -find_nel_with_attr ATTR ATTRVAL: Only output elements 
               that have an attribute ATTR of value ATTRVAL.
               a status of 1 is returned if no match is found.
   -find_nel_named NAME: Only print element named NAME
   -skip_nel_with_attr ATTR ATTRVAL: Do not output elements 
               that have an attribute ATTR of value ATTRVAL.
   -mw MAX_WAIT: Don't wait on a stream for more than MAX_WAIT
                 before you receive an element. Default is 100 msec.
                 Set MAX_WAIT to -1 to wait forever and a day
   niprobe returns a status of 0 if it the stream opened.
         and there were no interruptions.
