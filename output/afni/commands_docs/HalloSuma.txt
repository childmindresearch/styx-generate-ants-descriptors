=== Output of 'HalloSuma -help' ===

A program to illustrate how to communicate with SUMA
  with the help of AFNI's NIML API. Both the NIML API and this
  program are independent of the rest of AFNI/SUMA libraries and 
  can be compiled with C or C++ compilers.

This sample program was written in response to queries by herren 
  Joachim Bottger und Daniel Margulies

  Example:
     Run the following two commands, preferably from different shells.
     suma -npb 0 -niml &
     HalloSuma


=== Output of 'HalloSuma' (no arguments) ===
