Usage:   ANTSUseLandmarkImagesToGetBSplineDisplacementField fixedImageWithLabeledLandmarks  movingImageWithLabeledLandmarks outputDisplacementField meshSize[0]xmeshSize[1]x... numberOfLevels [order=3] [enforceStationaryBoundaries=1] [landmarkWeights]
 we expect the input images to be (1) N-ary  (2) in the same physical space as the images you want to 
 register and (3 ) to have the same landmark points defined within them ... 
 landmarks will be defined from the center of mass of the labels in the input images . 
 You can use ITK-snap to generate the label images. 
 The optional landmarks weights are read from a text file where each row is either:
 "label,labelWeight" or 
 "labelWeight" or 
 If the latter format is used, the label weights are assumed to be arranged in ascending order by label.
