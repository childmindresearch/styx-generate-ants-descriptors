Usage:  
ImageSetStatistics ImageDimension controlslist.txt outimage.nii whichstat {roi.nii} {imagelist2forsimilarityweightedstats.txt}
 whichstat = 0:  median,  1:  max prob appearance  , 2: weighted mean appearance ,  3: trimmed mean , 4 : max value , option 5 : similarity-weighted (must pass imagelist2 as well) else median , option 6 : same as similarity-weighted option 5 but the label corresponds to the image that provides the best local match ... useful if you want to MRF smooth these indices  , option 7 : similar to 5 but expects the max-value to be stored in the ROI image and uses it to get the intensity ... 
 example:   ImageSetStatistics  3   imagelist.txt  maxvalueimage.nii.gz 4 
 similarity weighted --- pass in a list of similarity images here which will be used to select the best label --- thus, number of similarity images must match the number of label images .
