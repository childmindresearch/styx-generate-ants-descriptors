COMMAND: 
     antsAlignOrigin
          antsAlignOrigin, applied to an input image, transforms it according to a 
          reference image and a transform (or a set of transforms). 

OPTIONS: 
     -d, --dimensionality 2/3
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, antsWarp tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image. 

     -i, --input inputFileName
          Currently, the only input objects supported are image objects. However, the 
          current framework allows for warping of other objects such as meshes and point 
          sets. 

     -r, --reference-image imageFileName
          For warping input images, the reference image defines the spacing, origin, size, 
          and direction of the output warped image. 

     -o, --output warpedOutputFileName
                  [transform,alignedImage]
          One can either output the warped image or, if the boolean is set, one can print 
          out the displacement field based on thecomposite transform and the reference 
          image.
