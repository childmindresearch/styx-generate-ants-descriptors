COMMAND: 
     DenoiseImage
          Denoise an image using a spatially adaptive filter originally described in J. V. 
          Manjon, P. Coupe, Luis Marti-Bonmati, D. L. Collins, and M. Robles. Adaptive 
          Non-Local Means Denoising of MR Images With Spatially Varying Noise Levels, 
          Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 31:192-203, June 2010. 

OPTIONS: 
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, the program tries to infer the dimensionality from the input 
          image. 

     -i, --input-image inputImageFilename
          A scalar image is expected as input for noise correction. 

     -n, --noise-model Rician/(Gaussian)
          Employ a Rician or Gaussian noise model. 

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          If a mask image is specified, denoising is only performed in the mask region. 

     -s, --shrink-factor (1)/2/3/...
          Running noise correction on large images can be time consuming. To lessen 
          computation time, the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified 
          as a single integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factor = 1 is the 
          default. 

     -p, --patch-radius 1
                        1x1x1
          Patch radius. Default = 1x1x1 

     -r, --search-radius 2
                         2x2x2
          Search radius. Default = 2x2x2. 

     -o, --output correctedImage
                  [correctedImage,<noiseImage>]
          The output consists of the noise corrected version of the input image. 
          Optionally, one can also output the estimated noise image. 

     --version 
          Get Version Information. 

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
          Verbose output. 

     -h 
          Print the help menu (short version). 

     --help 
          Print the help menu. 
          <VALUES>: 1
