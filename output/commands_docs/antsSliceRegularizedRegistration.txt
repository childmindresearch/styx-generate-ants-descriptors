     antsSliceRegularizedRegistration
          antsSliceRegularizedRegistration This program is a user-level application for 
          slice-by-slice translation registration. Results are regularized in z using 
          polynomial regression. The program is targeted at spinal cord MRI. Only one 
          stage is supported where a stage consists of a transform; an image metric; and 
          iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas for each level. Specialized for 
          3D data: fixed image is 3D, moving image is 3D. Registration is performed 
          slice-by-slice then regularized in z. The parameter -p controls the polynomial 
          degree. -p 0 means no regularization.Implemented by B. Avants and conceived by 
          Julien Cohen-Adad.

OPTIONS: 
     -m, --metric CC[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,radius,<samplingStrategy={Regular,Random,None}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>]
                  MI[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,numberOfBins,<samplingStrategy={Regular,Random,None}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>]
                  MeanSquares[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,radius,<samplingStrategy={Regular,Random,None}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>]
                  GC[fixedImage,movingImage,metricWeight,radius,<samplingStrategy={Regular,Random,None}>,<samplingPercentage=[0,1]>]
          Four image metrics are available--- GC : global correlation, CC: ANTS 
          neighborhood cross correlation, MI: Mutual information, and MeanSquares: 
          mean-squares intensity difference. Note that the metricWeight is currently not 
          used. Rather, it is a temporary place holder until multivariate metrics are 
          available for a single stage. 

     -x, --mask mask-in-fixed-image-space.nii.gz
          Fixed image mask to limit voxels considered by the metric.

          Several interpolation options are available in ITK. These have all been made 
          available. 

     -t, --transform Translation[gradientStep]
                     Rigid[gradientStep]
                     Similarity[gradientStep]
          Several transform options are available. The gradientStep orlearningRate 
          characterizes the gradient descent optimization and is scaled appropriately for 
          each transform using the shift scales estimator. Subsequent parameters are 
          transform-specific and can be determined from the usage. 

     -i, --iterations MxNx0...
          Specify the number of iterations at each level. 

     -s, --smoothingSigmas MxNx0...
          Specify the amount of smoothing at each level. 

     -f, --shrinkFactors MxNx0...
          Specify the shrink factor for the virtual domain (typically the fixed image) at 
          each level. 

     -o, --output [outputTransformPrefix,<outputWarpedImage>,<outputAverageImage>]
          Specify the output transform prefix (output format is .nii.gz ).Optionally, one 
          can choose to warp the moving image to the fixed space and, if the inverse 
          transform exists, one can also output the warped fixed image. 

     -h, --help 
          Print the help menu (short version). 
          <VALUES>: 1, 0
     -v, --verbose 
          verbose option 
          <VALUES>: 0

     -p, --polydegree 
          degree of polynomial - up to zDimension-2. Controls the polynomial degree. 0 
          means no regularization. This may be a vector denoted by 2x2x1 for a 3-parameter 
          transform ( e.g. rigid ). This would regularize the translation by 2nd degree 
          polynomial and the rotation by a linear function.
