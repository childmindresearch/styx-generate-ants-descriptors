Usage: ConvertImage imageDimension inputImage outputImage <pixelType>
pixelType:  0 -> float (default)
            1 -> unsigned char
            2 -> unsigned short
            3 -> unsigned int
            4 -> unsigned long
            5 -> char
            6 -> short
            7 -> int
            8 -> long
            9 -> component images to a float vector image
           10 -> vector image to component images
           11 -> time-varying velocity field image to component images (ImageDimension is the dimensionality of the displacement vector)
           12 -> float vector image
