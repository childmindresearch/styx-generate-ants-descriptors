COMMAND: 
     CreateDTICohort
          CreateDTICohort implements the work of Van Hecke et al. (On the construction of 
          a ground truth framework for evaluating voxl-based diffusion tensor MRI analysis 
          methods, Neuroimage 46:692-707, 2009) to create simulated DTI data sets. The 
          only difference is that all registrations (both for the input population and for 
          the output population) are assumed to take place outside of this program. 

OPTIONS: 
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, the program tries to infer the dimensionality from the input 
          image. 

     -a, --dti-atlas inputDTIAtlasFileName
          A diffusion tensor atlas image is required input for creating the cohort. 

     -x, --label-mask-image maskImageFileName
                            lowerThresholdFunction
          A mask image can be specified which determines the region(s). to which the 
          simulated pathology operations are applied. See also the option '--pathology'. 
          If no mask is specified one is created by thresholding the atlas FA map at 0.2 
          unless a lower threshold is specified. 

     -n, --noise-sigma <noiseSigma=18>
          This parameter characterizes the Rician noise in the original DWIimages. Van 
          Hecke uses the noise-estimation method of Sijbers et al. "Automatic estimation 
          of the noise variance from the histogram of a magnetic resonance image", Phys. 
          Med. Biol. 52:1335-1348, 2007. 

     -p, --pathology label[<propChangeEig1=-0.05>,<propChangeAvgEig2andEig3=0.05>,<numberOfVoxels=all or propOfVoxels>]
          The user can specify the simulated pathology in a given area using a label mask. 
          If no label is prepended to parameters, the specified parameters are applied to 
          all labels.Pathology is simulated by changing the eigenvalues. Typically this 
          involves a decrease in the largest eigenvalue and an increase in the average of 
          the remaining eigenvalues. Change is specified as a proportion of the current 
          eigenvalues. However, care is taken to ensure that diffusion direction does not 
          change. Additionally, one can specify the number of voxels affected in each 
          region or one can specify the proportion of voxels affected. Default is to 
          change all voxels. Note that the proportions must be specified in the range 
          [0,1]. For dimension=3 where the average transverse diffusion eigenvalues are 
          altered, this change is propagated to the distinct eigenvalues by forcing the 
          ratio to be the same before the change. 

     -w, --dwi-parameters [B0Image,directionFile,bvalue]
                          [B0Image,schemeFile]
          This option specifies the parameters of the output diffusion-weighted images 
          including the directions and b-values. The directions are specified using a 
          direction file which has as its first line the number of directions.Each 
          successive three lines contains the x, y, and z directions, respectively, and a 
          single b-value. Note that several direction files of this format are distributed 
          with the Camino DTI toolkit 
          (http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/medic/camino/pmwiki/pmwiki.php). 
          Alternatively, one can specify a scheme file where each direction is specified 
          followed by a b-value for that direction, i.e. <x1> <y1> <z1> <bvalue1> ... 
          <xN><yN><zN><bvalueN>. 

     -r, --registered-population textFileWithFileNames.txt
          If one wants to introduce inter-subject variabilitya registered DTI population 
          to the DTI atlas is required. This variability is modeled by a PCA decomposition 
          on a combination of the first eigenvalue image and the average of the second and 
          third eigenvalues.The registered image file names are specified using a text 
          file where each line is the name of an individual DTI. 

     -o, --output [outputDirectory,fileNameSeriesRootName,<numberOfControls=10>,<numberOfExperimentals=10>]
          The output consists of a set of diffusion-weighted images for each subject. Each 
          file name is prepended with the word 'Control' or 'Experimental'. The number of 
          control and experimental subjects can be also be specified on the command line. 
          Default is 10 for each group.
