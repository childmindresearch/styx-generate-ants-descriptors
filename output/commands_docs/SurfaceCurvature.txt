 This implements The Shape Operator for Differential Analysis of Images (google for the pdf)
 By B. Avants and J.C. Gee 
 Documentation is on demand --- if there is enough interest, documentation will improve.
 There are several modes of operation and you must try parameters and input either binary or gray scale images to see the different effects ---- experimentation or reading the (minimal) documentation /  paper / code is needed to understand the program 
 usage :  SurfaceCurvature FileNameIn FileNameOut sigma option  
 e.g  :   SurfaceCurvature    BrainIn.nii BrainOut.nii   3  0 
 option 0 means just compute mean curvature from intensity 
 option 5 means characterize surface from intensity 
 option 6 means compute gaussian curvature 
 option 7 means surface area 
 ... 
 for surface characterization 
 1 == (+) bowl 
 2 == (-) bowl  
 3 == (+) saddle 
 4 == (-) saddle 
 5 == (+) U 
 6 == (-) U 
 7 == flat 
 8 == a perfectly even saddle (rare) 
 
 we add 128 to mean curvature results s.t. they are differentiated from background (zero)
