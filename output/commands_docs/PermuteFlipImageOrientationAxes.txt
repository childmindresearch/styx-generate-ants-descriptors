Usage: 
PermuteFlipImageOrientationAxes ImageDimension  inputImageFile  outputImageFile xperm yperm {zperm}  xflip yflip {zflip}  {FlipAboutOrigin}
 for 3D:  PermuteFlipImageOrientationAxes 3  in.nii out.nii   2 0 1  1 1 1  
 would map z=>x, x=>y, y=>z and flip each 
 for 2D:  PermuteFlipImageOrientationAxes 2  in.nii out.nii   1 0  1 0  
 would map x=>y, y=>x and flip x  

 0 1 2 for permute factors gives no axis permutation 
 1 2 0 maps y to x,  z to y and x to z 
 the flip values are boolean -  0 1 0 would flip the y-axis only 

 The FlipAboutOrigin boolean lets you flip about the coordinate set in the origin
