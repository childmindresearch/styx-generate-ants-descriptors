Usage:   ANTSUseDeformationFieldToGetAffineTransform zzzWarp.nii.gz load_ratio(ex: 0.01) [rigid | affine] OutAffine.txt [mask.nii.gz]
 we expect the input deformation field in the same physical space as the images you want to 
load_ratio: ratio of points to be loaded from deformation field (to save memory) 
 the mask gives the region from which points will be selected ...
