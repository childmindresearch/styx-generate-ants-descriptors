 we expect the input images to be (1) N-ary  (2) in the same physical space as the images you want to 
 register and (3 ) to have the same landmark points defined within them ... 
 landmarks will be defined from the center of mass of the labels in the input images . 
 You can use ITK-snap to generate the label images.
