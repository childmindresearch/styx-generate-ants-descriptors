antsCorticalThickness.sh performs T1 anatomical brain processing where the following steps are currently applied:

  1. Brain extraction
  2. Brain n-tissue segmentation
  3. Cortical thickness
  4. (Optional) registration to a template

Usage:

antsCorticalThickness.sh -d imageDimension
              -a anatomicalImage
              -e brainTemplate
              -m brainExtractionProbabilityMask
              -p brainSegmentationPriors
              <OPTARGS>
              -o outputPrefix

Example:

  bash /opt/ants/bin/antsCorticalThickness.sh -d 3 -a t1.nii.gz -e brainWithSkullTemplate.nii.gz -m brainPrior.nii.gz -p segmentationPriors%d.nii.gz -o output

Required arguments:

We use *intensity* to denote the original anatomical image of the brain.

We use *probability* to denote a probability image with values in range 0 to 1.

We use *label* to denote a label image with values in range 0 to N.

     -d:  Image dimension                       2 or 3 (for 2- or 3-dimensional image)

     -a:  Anatomical image                      Structural *intensity* image, typically T1.  If more than one
                                                anatomical image is specified, subsequently specified
                                                images are used during the segmentation process.  However,
                                                only the first image is used in the registration of priors.
                                                We recommend using the T1 as the first image.

     -e:  Brain segmentation template           Anatomical *intensity* template. This template is *not* skull-stripped.
                                                The following images must be in the same space as this template:
                                                    * Brain probability mask (-m)
                                                    * Segmentation priors (-p).
                                                If used, the following optional images must also be in the same space as
                                                this template:
                                                    * Registration metric mask (-f)
                                                    * Thickness prior image (-r).

     -m:  Brain extraction probability mask     Brain *probability* mask in the segmentation template space. A binary mask
                                                is an acceptable probability image.

     -p:  Brain segmentation priors             Tissue *probability* priors corresponding to the template image specified
                                                with the -e option.  Specified using c-style formatting, either with numeric indices
                                                e.g.
                                                  -p template/priors/Priors%02d.nii.gz
                                                or BIDS style, eg
                                                  -p tpl-templateName/tpl-templateName_res-01_label-%s_probseg.nii.gz

                                                At least four priors must exist, corresponding to CSF, Cortical GM, WM, Subcortical GM.
                                                If priors are numbered numerically, the classes must be ordered in the same way, ie
                                                  1:  CSF
                                                  2:  Cortical GM
                                                  3:  WM
                                                  4:  Subcortical GM

                                                In BIDS format, the labels must include CSF, CGM, WM, SGM, and may optionally include BS, CBM.
                                                Other labels will not be used. Templateflow labels use "SCGM" instead of "SGM", if "SGM" is not
                                                found, "SCGM" will be used instead.

Optional arguments:

     -s:  image file suffix                     Any of the standard ITK IO formats e.g. nrrd, nii.gz (default), mhd.

     -t:  template for t1 registration          Anatomical *intensity* template. This template *must* be skull-stripped.
                                                This template is used to produce a final, high-quality registration between
                                                the bias-corrected, skull-stripped subject anatomical image and the template.
                                                This template will commonly be a skull-stripped version of the template passed
                                                with -e. We perform the registration with fixed image = (this template)
                                                and moving image = (input anatomical image).

     -f:  extraction registration mask          Binary metric mask defined in the segmentation template space (-e). During the
                                                registration for brain extraction, the similarity metric is only computed within
                                                this mask.

     -k:  keep temporary files                  Keep brain extraction/segmentation warps, etc (default = 0).

     -g:  denoise anatomical images             Denoise anatomical images (default = 0).

     -i:  max iterations for registration       ANTS registration max iterations (default = 100x100x70x20).

     -w:  Atropos prior segmentation weight     Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation (default = 0.25).

     -n:  number of segmentation iterations     N4 -> Atropos -> N4 iterations during segmentation (default = 3).

     -b:  posterior formulation                 Atropos posterior formulation and whether or not to use mixture model proportions.
                                                e.g 'Socrates[ 1 ]' (default) or 'Aristotle[ 1 ]'.  Choose the latter if you
                                                want use the distance priors (see also the -l option for label propagation
                                                control).

     -j:  use floating-point precision          Use single float precision in registrations (default = 0).

     -u:  use random seeding                    Use random number generated from system clock (default = 1). If 0, a fixed
                                                random seed is used. To set your own seed, set this option to 0 and export the
                                                environment variable ANTS_RANDOM_SEED. To achieve exactly identical results, you must
                                                also set ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS to 1.

     -v:  use b-spline smoothing                Use B-spline SyN for registrations and B-spline exponential mapping in DiReCT (default = 0).

     -r:  cortical thickness prior image        Cortical thickness prior image in the template space, which contains an estimated
                                                upper limit to the cortical thickness at each voxel. If not specified, the prior is
                                                set to 10mm throughout the brain.

     -l:  label propagation                     Incorporate a distance prior one the posterior formulation.  Should be
                                                of the form 'label[ lambda,boundaryProbability ]' where label is a value
                                                of 1,2,3,... denoting label ID.  The label probability for anything
                                                outside the current label

                                                  = boundaryProbability * exp( -lambda * distanceFromBoundary )

                                                Intuitively, smaller lambda values will increase the spatial capture
                                                range of the distance prior.  To apply to all label values, simply omit
                                                specifying the label, i.e. '-l "[ lambda,boundaryProbability ]"'.

     -c:  Additional priors for thickness       Add segmentation classes to be treated as gray or white matter for thickness
                                                estimation. For example, when calling KellyKapowski for normal subjects, we
                                                combine the deep gray matter segmentation/posteriors (class 4) with the white
                                                matter segmentation/posteriors (class 3).
                                                Another example would be computing cortical thickness in the presence
                                                of white matter lesions. We can accommodate this by specifying a lesion mask
                                                posterior as an additional posterior (suppose label '7'), combining this with
                                                normal white matter in the thickness estimation by specifying '-c "WM[ 7 ]"'
                                                or '-c "3[ 7 ]"'.

     -q:  Use quick registration parameters     If = 1, use antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh as the basis for registration
                                                during brain extraction, brain segmentation, and (optional) normalization
                                                to a template.  Otherwise use a slower registration comparable to
                                                antsRegistrationSyN.sh (default = 0).

     -x:  Atropos iterations                    Number of iterations within Atropos (default 5).

     -y:  Script stage to run                   Which stage of ACT to run (default = 0, run all).  Tries to split in 2 hour chunks.
                                                Will produce OutputNameACTStageNComplete.txt for each completed stage.
