Usage: mp_diff regparam.dat diffregparam.dat

Creates file with 18 columns; the first 6 are the square of the motion
parameters, the next 6 are the temporal difference of motion parameters, 
and the next 6 are the square of the differenced values.  This is useful for
accounting for 'spin history' effects, and variation not 
otherwise accounted for by motion correction.
