Usage:  make_bianca_mask <structural_image> <CSF pve> <warp_file_MNI2structural> <keep_intermediate_files>
 
The first input is the basename of the structural image (e.g. T1_biascorr). The script works under the assumption that the brain extracted image would be called <structural image>_brain.nii.gz
The second input is the corresponding CSF partial volume map calculated with FAST
The third input is the non-linear transformation warp file from standard space to structural image
If you want to keep intermediate files (e.g. for debugging), add 1 as 4th input
 
e.g.make_bianca_mask T1_biascorr T1_fast_pve_0 MNI_to_T1_nonlin_field.nii.gz
 
Output: the script creates two files called <structural image>_bianca_mask.nii.gz , <structural image>_ventmask.nii.gz
The first masks can be used to remove candidate lesions from the automatic segmentation via fslmaths:
  e.g.   fslmaths sub001_bianca_output -mas T1_bianca_mask.nii.gz sub001_bianca_output_masked
alternatively, it can be used to mask one of the input images to restrict the search for lesions within a tighter brain mask
 e.g. fslmaths FLAIR -mas T1_bianca_mask_to_FLAIR FLAIR_masked
The second mask can be used to calculate ventricle volumes or to extract periventricular lesions (as those whithin a certain distance from the ventricles)
