ERROR: Orientation information not stored in --help!
Cannot reslice without orientation information (i.e. need valid labels in FSLView)
The NIfTI image must contain a non-zero code for either the sform or the qform
 - check your reconstruction/conversion software to try and fix this

Usage: fslreorient2std [-m <matrix file>] <input_image> [output_image]
 
fslreorient2std is a tool for reorienting the image to match the
approximate orientation of the standard template images (MNI152).
It only applies 0, 90, 180 or 270 degree rotations.
It is not a registration tool.
It requires NIfTI images with valid orientation information
in them (seen by valid labels in FSLView).  This tool
assumes the labels are correct - if not, fix that before using this.
If the output name is not specified the equivalent transformation
 matrix is written to the standard output
If the option -m is given, with an accompanying filename, then the
 transformation matrix is written to this file instead
