wpng 1.03 of 19 March 2000:  Simple PGM/PPM/PAM to PNG Converter
   Compiled with libpng 1.6.7; using libpng 1.6.7.
   Compiled with zlib 1.2.8; using zlib 1.2.8.

Usage:  wpng [-gamma exp] [-bgcolor bg] [-text] [-time] [-interlace] pnmfile
or: ... | wpng [-gamma exp] [-bgcolor bg] [-text] [-time] [-interlace] | ...
    exp 	transfer-function exponent (``gamma'') of the image in
		  floating-point format (e.g., ``0.45455''); if image looks
		  correct on given display system, image gamma is equal to
		  inverse of display-system exponent, i.e., 1 / (LUT * CRT)
		  (where LUT = lookup-table exponent and CRT = CRT exponent;

		  first varies, second is usually 2.2, all are positive)
    bg  	desired background color for alpha-channel images, in
		  7-character hex RGB format (e.g., ``#ff7700'' for orange:
		  same as HTML colors)
    -text	prompt interactively for text info (tEXt chunks)
    -time	include a tIME chunk (last modification time)
    -interlace	write interlaced PNG image

pnmfile or stdin must be a binary PGM (`P5'), PPM (`P6') or (extremely
unofficial and unsupported!) PAM (`P8') file.  Currently it is required
to have maxval == 255 (i.e., no scaling).  If pnmfile is specified, it
is converted to the corresponding PNG file with the same base name but a
``.png'' extension; files read from stdin are converted and sent to stdout.
The conversion is progressive (low memory usage) unless interlacing is
requested; in that case the whole image will be buffered in memory and
written in one call.
