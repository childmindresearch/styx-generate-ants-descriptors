<group_IC_maps_4D>            4D image containing spatial IC maps (melodic_IC) from the whole-group ICA analysis
<des_norm>                    0 or 1 (1 is recommended). Whether to variance-normalise the timecourses used as the stage-2 regressors
<design.mat>                  Design matrix for final cross-subject modelling with randomise

<n_perm>                      Number of permutations for randomise; set to 1 for just raw tstat output, set to 0 to not run randomise at all.
[--thr]                       Perform thresholded dual regression to obtain unbiased timeseries for connectomics analyses (e.g., with FSLnets)
<output_directory>            This directory will be created to hold all output and logfilesg
<input1> <input2> ...         List all subjects' preprocessed, standard-space 4D datasets

<design.mat> <design.con>     can be replaced with just
-1                            for group-mean (one-group t-test) modelling.
If you need to add other randomise options then edit the line after "EDIT HERE" in the dual_regression script
