=== Output of 'bianca_overlap_measures' (no arguments) ===

Usage: bianca_overlap_measures <lesionmask> <threshold> <manualmask> <saveoutput>
 
the script calculates measures of overlap between the lesion mask generated by BIANCA and the manual mask and lesion volumes of both
threshold = probability threshold that will be applied to BIANCA output before calculation of the overlap measures
saveoutput = if set to 0 it will output the measures' names and values on the screen with the following format:
DICEsimilarityindex(SI) FalseDiscoveryRate(FDR) FalseNegativeRatio(FNR) FDRcluster-level FNRcluster-level DetectionErrorRate(DER) OutlineErrorRate(OER) MeanTotalArea(MTA) LESIONmaskVolume MANUALmaskVolume
             if set to 1 it will save only the values (in the same order) in a .txt file
             the output file will be saved in the same folder of the lesion mask (BIANCA output) with the name Overlap_and_Volumes_<lesionmask>_<threshold>.txt
