fsl_sub V1.1 - wrapper for job control system such as SGE

Usage: fsl_sub [options] <command>

fsl_sub gzip *.img *.hdr
fsl_sub -q short.q gzip *.img *.hdr
fsl_sub -a darwin regscript rawdata outputdir ...

  -T <minutes>          Estimated job length in minutes, used to auto-set queue name
  -q <queuename>        Possible values for <queuename> are "verylong.q", "long.q"
                        and "short.q". See below for details
                        Default is "long.q".
  -a <arch-name>        Architecture [e.g., darwin or lx24-amd64]
  -p <job-priority>     Lower priority [0:-1024] default = 0
  -M <email-address>    Who to email, default = root@37982b8d57df
  -j <jid>              Place a hold on this task until job jid has completed
  -t <filename>         Specify a task file of commands to execute in parallel
  -N <jobname>          Specify jobname as it will appear on queue
  -R <RAM>              Max total RAM to use for job (integer in MB)
  -l <logdirname>       Where to output logfiles
  -m <mailoptions>      Change the SGE mail options, see qsub for details
  -z <output>           If <output> image or file already exists, do nothing and exit
  -F                    Use flags embedded in scripts to set SGE queuing options
  -s <pename>,<threads> Submit a multi-threaded task - requires a PE (<pename>) to be
                        configured for the requested queues.
                        <threads> specifies the number of threads to run
  -v                    Verbose mode.

Queues:

There are several batch queues configured on the cluster, each with defined CPU
time limits. All queues, except bigmem.q, have a 8GB memory limit.

veryshort.q:This queue is for jobs which last under 30mins.
short.q:    This queue is for jobs which last up to 4h.
long.q:     This queue is for jobs which last less than 24h. Jobs run with a
            nice value of 10.
verylong.q: This queue is for jobs which will take longer than 24h CPU time.
            There is one slot per node, and jobs on this queue have a nice value
            of 15.
bigmem.q:   This queue is like the verylong.q but has no memory limits.
