Usage: tbss_deproject <skeleton-space-input-image> <final-space> [-n]

Final-space options:
1: just deproject <skeleton-space-input-image> onto the space of each subject in all_FA (output in "stats" directory)
2: do the above and also invert nonlinear warping, to get back to subjects' native space in FA (outputs in "FA" directory)

-n : assume that <skeleton-space-input-image> contains one or more integer index numbers and ensure that those exact values are deprojected without being changed by interpolations
