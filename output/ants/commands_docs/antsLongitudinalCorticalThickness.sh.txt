antsLongitudinalCorticalThickness.sh performs a longitudinal cortical thickness estimation.  The following steps
are performed:
  1. Create a single-subject template (SST) from all the anatomical images.
  2. Create priors for the SST
     a. Run the SST through the individual cortical thickness pipeline using the group
        template and associated priors.
     b. The brain extraction SST prior is created by smoothing the brain extraction
        mask created during 2a.
     c. If labeled atlases are not provided, we smooth the posteriors from 2a to create
        the SST segmentation priors, otherwise we use antsJointFusion to create a set of
        posteriors (https://github.com/ntustison/antsCookTemplatePriorsExample).
  3. Using the SST + priors, we run each time point image through the antsCorticalThickness
     pipeline.
  4. Compose (time point) -> SST and SST -> (group template) warps to deform images from the
     native anatomical space to the group template.

Required arguments:

     -d:  Image dimension                       2 or 3 (for 2- or 3-dimensional image)

     -e:  Brain segmentation template           Anatomical *intensity* template. This template is *not* skull-stripped.
                                                The following images must be in the same space as this template:
                                                    * Brain probability mask (-m)
                                                    * Segmentation priors (-p).
                                                If used, the following optional images must also be in the same space as
                                                this template:
                                                    * Registration metric mask (-f).

     -m:  Brain extraction probability mask     Brain *probability* mask in the segmentation template space. A binary mask
                                                is an acceptable probability image.

     -p:  Brain segmentation priors             Tissue *probability* priors corresponding to the image specified
                                                with the -e option.  Specified using c-style formatting, either with numeric indices
                                                e.g.

                                                At least four priors must exist, corresponding to CSF, Cortical GM, WM, Subcortical GM.
                                                If priors are numbered numerically, the classes must be ordered in the same way, ie
                                                  1:  CSF
                                                  2:  Cortical GM
                                                  3:  WM
                                                  4:  Subcortical GM

                                                In BIDS format, the labels must include CSF, CGM, WM, SGM, and may optionally include BS, CBM.
                                                Other labels will not be used. Templateflow labels use "SCGM" instead of "SGM", if "SGM" is not
                                                found, "SCGM" will be used instead.

     -o:  Output prefix                         The following subdirectory and images are created for the single

                                                A subdirectory is created for each anatomical image.

     anatomical images                          Set of multimodal input data assumed to be specified ordered as
                                                follows:
                                                  ${time1_modality1} ${time1_modality2} ... ${time1_modalityN} \
                                                  ${time2_modality1} ${time2_modality2} ...
                                                  .
                                                  .
                                                  .
                                                  ${timeN_modality1} ...

                                                A single modality is expected by default, in which case the input images
                                                are simply ordered by time:

                                                  ${time1_modality1} ${time2_modality1} ... ${timeN_modality1}

                                                If there are multiple modalities, use the -k option to specify how many.

Optional arguments:

     -s:  image file suffix                     Any of the standard ITK IO formats e.g. nrrd, nii.gz (default), mhd

     -c:  control type                          Control for parallel computation (default 0):
                                                  0 = run serially
                                                  1 = SGE qsub
                                                  2 = use PEXEC (localhost)
                                                  3 = Apple XGrid
                                                  4 = PBS qsub
                                                  5 = SLURM.

     -t:  template for t1 registration          Anatomical *intensity* template. This template *must* be skull-stripped.
                                                This template is used to produce a final, high-quality registration between
                                                the skull-stripped single-subject template and this template.

     -a:                                        Atlases (assumed to be skull-stripped) used to cook template priors. If atlases
                                                aren't used then we simply smooth the single-subject template posteriors after
                                                passing through antsCorticalThickness.sh. Example:

                                                  -a atlas1.nii.gz -a atlas2.nii.gz ... -a atlasN.nii.gz

     -l:                                        Labels associated with each atlas, in the same order as they are specified
                                                with the -a option. The number of labels in each image is assumed to be equal
                                                to the number of priors.

     -f:  extraction registration mask          Binary metric mask defined in the segmentation template space (-e). During the
                                                registration for brain extraction, the similarity metric is only computed within
                                                this mask.

     -g:  denoise anatomical images             Denoise anatomical images (default = 0).

     -j:  number of cpu cores                   Number of cpu cores to use locally for pexec option (default 2; requires "-c 2").

     -k:  number of modalities                  Number of modalities used to construct the template (default 1):  For example,
                                                if one wanted to use multiple modalities consisting of T1, T2, and FA
                                                components ("-k 3").

     -n:  use SST cortical thickness prior      If set to '1', the cortical thickness map from the single-subject template is used
                                                as a prior constraint for each of the individual calls to antsCorticalThickness.sh
                                                (default = 0).

     -u:  use single float precision            If 1, use single float precision in registrations (default = 0).

     -v:  Atropos segmentation weight (SST)     Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the
                                                single-subject template (default = 0.25).

     -w:  Atropos segmentation weight (Indiv.)  Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the individual
                                                time points (default = 0.5).

     -x:                                        Number of iterations within Atropos (default 5).

     -q:  Use quick registration parameters     Use antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh for some or all of the registrations.
                                                The higher the number, the more registrations are performed quickly. The options are
                                                as follows:
                                                  '-q 0' = antsRegistrationSyN.sh for everything (default)
                                                  '-q 1' = Quick registration of time points to the SST
                                                  '-q 2' = Adds quick registrations for prior cooking
                                                  '-q 3' = Quick registrations throughout.

     -r:  rigid alignment to SST                If 1, register anatomical images to the single-subject template before processing
                                                with antsCorticalThickness. This potentially reduces bias caused by variable
                                                orientation and voxel spacing (default = 0).

     -b:  keep temporary files                  Keep brain extraction/segmentation warps, etc (default = 0).

     -y:  rigid template update component       Update the single-subject template with the full affine transform (default 0).
                                                If 1, the rigid component of the affine transform will be used to update the
                                                template. Using the rigid component is desireable to reduce bias, but variations
                                                in the origin or head position across time points can cause the template head to
                                                drift out of the field of view.

     -z:  Test / debug mode                     If > 0, runs a faster version of the script. Only for testing. Implies -u 0
                                                in the antsCorticalThickness.sh script (i.e., no random seeding).
                                                Requires single thread computation for complete reproducibility.

     anatomical images                          Set of multimodal input data assumed to be specified ordered as
                                                follows:
                                                  ${time1_modality1} ${time1_modality2} ... ${time1_modalityN} \

                                                A single modality is expected by default, in which case the input images
                                                are simply ordered by time:

                                                  ${time1_modality1} ${time2_modality1} ... ${timeN_modality1}

                                                If there are multiple modalities, use the -k option to specify how many.

     -t:  template for t1 registration          Anatomical *intensity* template. This template *must* be skull-stripped.
                                                This template is used to produce a final, high-quality registration between
                                                the skull-stripped single-subject template and this template.

     -a:                                        Atlases (assumed to be skull-stripped) used to cook template priors. If atlases
                                                aren't used then we simply smooth the single-subject template posteriors after
                                                passing through antsCorticalThickness.sh. Example:

                                                  -a atlas1.nii.gz -a atlas2.nii.gz ... -a atlasN.nii.gz

     -l:                                        Labels associated with each atlas, in the same order as they are specified
                                                with the -a option. The number of labels in each image is assumed to be equal
                                                to the number of priors.

     -f:  extraction registration mask          Binary metric mask defined in the segmentation template space (-e). During the
                                                registration for brain extraction, the similarity metric is only computed within
                                                this mask.

     -g:  denoise anatomical images             Denoise anatomical images (default = 0).

     -j:  number of cpu cores                   Number of cpu cores to use locally for pexec option (default 2; requires "-c 2").

     -k:  number of modalities                  Number of modalities used to construct the template (default 1):  For example,
                                                if one wanted to use multiple modalities consisting of T1, T2, and FA
                                                components ("-k 3").

     -n:  use SST cortical thickness prior      If set to '1', the cortical thickness map from the single-subject template is used
                                                as a prior constraint for each of the individual calls to antsCorticalThickness.sh
                                                (default = 0).

     -u:  use single float precision            If 1, use single float precision in registrations (default = 0).

     -v:  Atropos segmentation weight (SST)     Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the
                                                single-subject template (default = 0.25).

     -w:  Atropos segmentation weight (Indiv.)  Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the individual
                                                time points (default = 0.5).

     -x:                                        Number of iterations within Atropos (default 5).

     -q:  Use quick registration parameters     Use antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh for some or all of the registrations.
                                                The higher the number, the more registrations are performed quickly. The options are
                                                as follows:
                                                  '-q 0' = antsRegistrationSyN.sh for everything (default)
                                                  '-q 1' = Quick registration of time points to the SST
                                                  '-q 2' = Adds quick registrations for prior cooking
                                                  '-q 3' = Quick registrations throughout.

     -r:  rigid alignment to SST                If 1, register anatomical images to the single-subject template before processing
                                                with antsCorticalThickness. This potentially reduces bias caused by variable
                                                orientation and voxel spacing (default = 0).

     -b:  keep temporary files                  Keep brain extraction/segmentation warps, etc (default = 0).

     -y:  rigid template update component       Update the single-subject template with the full affine transform (default 0).
                                                If 1, the rigid component of the affine transform will be used to update the
                                                template. Using the rigid component is desireable to reduce bias, but variations
                                                in the origin or head position across time points can cause the template head to
                                                drift out of the field of view.

     -z:  Test / debug mode                     If > 0, runs a faster version of the script. Only for testing. Implies -u 0
                                                in the antsCorticalThickness.sh script (i.e., no random seeding).
                                                Requires single thread computation for complete reproducibility.

=== Output of 'antsLongitudinalCorticalThickness.sh' (no arguments) ===


antsLongitudinalCorticalThickness.sh performs a longitudinal cortical thickness estimation.  The following steps
are performed:
  1. Create a single-subject template (SST) from all the anatomical images.
  2. Create priors for the SST
     a. Run the SST through the individual cortical thickness pipeline using the group
        template and associated priors.
     b. The brain extraction SST prior is created by smoothing the brain extraction
        mask created during 2a.
     c. If labeled atlases are not provided, we smooth the posteriors from 2a to create
        the SST segmentation priors, otherwise we use antsJointFusion to create a set of
        posteriors (https://github.com/ntustison/antsCookTemplatePriorsExample).
  3. Using the SST + priors, we run each time point image through the antsCorticalThickness
     pipeline.
  4. Compose (time point) -> SST and SST -> (group template) warps to deform images from the
     native anatomical space to the group template.

Required arguments:

     -d:  Image dimension                       2 or 3 (for 2- or 3-dimensional image)

     -e:  Brain segmentation template           Anatomical *intensity* template. This template is *not* skull-stripped.
                                                The following images must be in the same space as this template:
                                                    * Brain probability mask (-m)
                                                    * Segmentation priors (-p).
                                                If used, the following optional images must also be in the same space as
                                                this template:
                                                    * Registration metric mask (-f).

     -m:  Brain extraction probability mask     Brain *probability* mask in the segmentation template space. A binary mask
                                                is an acceptable probability image.

     -p:  Brain segmentation priors             Tissue *probability* priors corresponding to the image specified
                                                with the -e option.  Specified using c-style formatting, either with numeric indices
                                                e.g.
                                                  -p template/priors/Priors%02d.nii.gz
                                                or BIDS style, eg

                                                At least four priors must exist, corresponding to CSF, Cortical GM, WM, Subcortical GM.
                                                If priors are numbered numerically, the classes must be ordered in the same way, ie
                                                  1:  CSF
                                                  2:  Cortical GM
                                                  3:  WM
                                                  4:  Subcortical GM

                                                In BIDS format, the labels must include CSF, CGM, WM, SGM, and may optionally include BS, CBM.
                                                Other labels will not be used. Templateflow labels use "SCGM" instead of "SGM", if "SGM" is not
                                                found, "SCGM" will be used instead.

     -g:  denoise anatomical images             Denoise anatomical images (default = 0).

     -j:  number of cpu cores                   Number of cpu cores to use locally for pexec option (default 2; requires "-c 2").

     -k:  number of modalities                  Number of modalities used to construct the template (default 1):  For example,
                                                if one wanted to use multiple modalities consisting of T1, T2, and FA
                                                components ("-k 3").

     -n:  use SST cortical thickness prior      If set to '1', the cortical thickness map from the single-subject template is used
                                                as a prior constraint for each of the individual calls to antsCorticalThickness.sh
                                                (default = 0).

     -u:  use single float precision            If 1, use single float precision in registrations (default = 0).

     -v:  Atropos segmentation weight (SST)     Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the
                                                single-subject template (default = 0.25).

     -w:  Atropos segmentation weight (Indiv.)  Atropos spatial prior *probability* weight for the segmentation of the individual
                                                time points (default = 0.5).

     -x:                                        Number of iterations within Atropos (default 5).

     -q:  Use quick registration parameters     Use antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh for some or all of the registrations.
                                                The higher the number, the more registrations are performed quickly. The options are
                                                as follows:
                                                  '-q 0' = antsRegistrationSyN.sh for everything (default)
                                                  '-q 1' = Quick registration of time points to the SST
                                                  '-q 2' = Adds quick registrations for prior cooking
                                                  '-q 3' = Quick registrations throughout.

     -r:  rigid alignment to SST                If 1, register anatomical images to the single-subject template before processing
                                                with antsCorticalThickness. This potentially reduces bias caused by variable
                                                orientation and voxel spacing (default = 0).

     -b:  keep temporary files                  Keep brain extraction/segmentation warps, etc (default = 0).

     -y:  rigid template update component       Update the single-subject template with the full affine transform (default 0).
                                                If 1, the rigid component of the affine transform will be used to update the
                                                template. Using the rigid component is desireable to reduce bias, but variations
                                                in the origin or head position across time points can cause the template head to
                                                drift out of the field of view.

     -z:  Test / debug mode                     If > 0, runs a faster version of the script. Only for testing. Implies -u 0
                                                in the antsCorticalThickness.sh script (i.e., no random seeding).
                                                Requires single thread computation for complete reproducibility.
