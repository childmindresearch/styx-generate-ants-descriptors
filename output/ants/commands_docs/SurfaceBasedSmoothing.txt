 usage :  SurfaceBasedSmoothing ImageToSmooth  sigma SurfaceImage  outname  {numrepeatsofsmoothing}
 We assume the SurfaceImage has a label == 1 that defines the surface 
 sigma  defines the geodesic n-hood radius --- numrepeats allows one to use 
 a small geodesic n-hood repeatedly applied many times -- faster computation, same effect
