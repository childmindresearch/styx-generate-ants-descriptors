COMMAND: 
     N3BiasFieldCorrection
          This N3 is a variant of the popular N3 (nonparameteric nonuniform normalization) 
          retrospective bias correction algorithm. Based on the assumption that the 
          corruption of the low frequency bias field can be modeled as a convolution of 
          the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, the basic algorithmic protocol is to 
          iterate between deconvolving the intensity histogram by a Gaussian, remapping 
          the intensities, and then spatially smoothing this result by a B-spline modeling 
          of the bias field itself. 

OPTIONS: 
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, N3 tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image. 

     -i, --input-image inputImageFilename
          A scalar image is expected as input for bias correction. Since N3 log transforms 
          the intensities, negative values or values close to zero should be processed 
          prior to correction. 

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          If a mask image is specified, the final bias correction is only performed in the 
          mask region. If a weight image is not specified, only intensity values inside 
          the masked region are used during the execution of the algorithm. If a weight 
          image is specified, only the non-zero weights are used in the execution of the 
          algorithm although the mask region defines where bias correction is performed in 
          the final output. Otherwise bias correction occurs over the entire image domain. 
          See also the option description for the weight image. If a mask image is *not* 
          specified then the entire image region will be used as the mask region. Note 
          that this is different than the N3 implementation which uses the results of Otsu 
          thresholding to define a mask. However, this leads to unknown anatomical regions 
          being included and excluded during the bias correction. 

     -r, --rescale-intensities 0/(1)
          At each iteration, a new intensity mapping is calculated and applied but there 
          is nothing which constrains the new intensity range to be within certain values. 
          The result is that the range can "drift" from the original at each iteration. 
          This option rescales to the [min,max] range of the original image intensities 
          within the user-specified mask. 

     -w, --weight-image weightImageFilename
          The weight image allows the user to perform a relative weighting of specific 
          voxels during the B-spline fitting. For example, some studies have shown that N3 
          performed on white matter segmentations improves performance. If one has a 
          spatial probability map of the white matter, one can use this map to weight the 
          b-spline fitting towards those voxels which are more probabilistically 
          classified as white matter. See also the option description for the mask image. 

     -s, --shrink-factor 1/2/3/(4)/...
          Running N3 on large images can be time consuming. To lessen computation time, 
          the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified as a single 
          integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factors <= 4 are commonly used.Note 
          that the shrink factor is only applied to the first two or three dimensions 
          which we assume are spatial. 

     -c, --convergence [<numberOfIterations=50>,<convergenceThreshold=0.0>]
          Convergence is determined by calculating the sigma of the coefficient of 
          variation between subsequent iterations. When this value is less than the 
          specified threshold from the previous iteration or the maximum number of 
          iterations is exceeded the program terminates. 

     -b, --bspline-fitting [splineDistance,<numberOfFittingLevels=4>,<splineOrder=3>]
                           [meshResolution,<numberOfFittingLevels=4>,<splineOrder=3>]
          These options describe the b-spline fitting parameters. The b-spline mesh is 
          specified either as the number of elements in each dimension, e.g. 2x2x3 for 3-D 
          images, or it can be specified as a single scalar parameter which describes the 
          isotropic sizing of the mesh elements. The latter option is typically preferred. 
          The default setting is to employ a single mesh element over the entire domain, 
          i.e., -b [1x1x1,4,3]. 

     -t, --histogram-sharpening [<FWHM=0.15>,<wienerNoise=0.01>,<numberOfHistogramBins=200>]
          These options describe the histogram sharpening parameters, i.e. the 
          deconvolution step parameters described in the original N3 algorithm. The 
          default values have been shown to work fairly well. 

     -o, --output correctedImage
                  [correctedImage,<biasField>]
          The output consists of the bias corrected version of the input image. 
          Optionally, one can also output the estimated bias field. 

     --version

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
