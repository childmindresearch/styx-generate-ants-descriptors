Usage: StackSlices outputvolume x y z inputvolume(s)
  The specific slice is chosen by specifying the index for x, y, xor z.
  For example, an "x y z" selection of "30 -1 -1" will stack slice 30 
  along the first dimension.  Also note that input 4-D volumes are treated 
  as a series of 3-D volumes.
