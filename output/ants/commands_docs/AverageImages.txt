Usage: 

AverageImages ImageDimension Outputfname.nii.gz Normalize <images> 

 Compulsory arguments: 

 ImageDimension: 2 or 3 (for 2 or 3 dimensional input).
 
 Outputfname.nii.gz: the name of the resulting image.

 Normalize: 0 - no normalization (this is the only option for multi-component images)
            1 - input images are divided by their mean before averaging; Laplacian sharpening is applied to the average
            2 - input images are divided by their mean before averaging; no sharpening

 Images are resampled into the space of the largest input image.
 Normalization options only apply to single-component input.

 Example Usage:

AverageImages 3 average.nii.gz  1  *.nii.gz
