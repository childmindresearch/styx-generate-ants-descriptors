Usage:   ANTSIntegrateVectorField  VecImageIN.nii.gz ROIMaskIN.nii.gz FibersOUT.vtk  LengthImageOUT.nii.gz   
 The vector field should have vectors as voxels , the ROI is an integer image, fibers out will be vtk text files .... 
  ROI-Mask controls where the integration is performed and the start point region ... 
 e.g. the brain will have value 1 , the ROI has value 2 , then all starting seed points 
 for the integration will start in the region labeled 2 and be constrained to the region labeled 1.
