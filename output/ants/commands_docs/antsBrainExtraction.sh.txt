antsBrainExtraction.sh performs template-based brain extraction.

Usage:

antsBrainExtraction.sh -d imageDimension
              -a anatomicalImage
              -e brainExtractionTemplate
              -m brainExtractionProbabilityMask
              <OPT_ARGS>
              -o outputPrefix

Example:

  bash /opt/ants/bin/antsBrainExtraction.sh -d 3 -a t1.nii.gz -e brainWithSkullTemplate.nii.gz -m brainPrior.nii.gz -o output

Required arguments:

     -d:  Image dimension                       2 or 3 for 2- or 3-dimensional image (default = 3)
     -a:  Anatomical image                      Structural image, typically T1.  If more than one
                                                anatomical image is specified, subsequently specified
                                                images are used during the segmentation process.  However,
                                                only the first image is used in the registration of priors.
                                                Our suggestion would be to specify the T1 as the first image.
     -e:  Brain extraction template             Anatomical template.
     -m:  Brain extraction probability mask     Brain probability mask, with intensity range 1 (definitely brain)
                                                to 0 (definitely background).
     -o:  Output prefix                         Output directory + file prefix.

Optional arguments:

     -c:  Tissue classification                 A k-means segmentation is run to find gray or white matter around
                                                the edge of the initial brain mask warped from the template.
                                                This produces a segmentation image with K classes, ordered by mean
                                                intensity in increasing order. With this option, you can control
                                                K and tell the script which classes represent CSF, gray and white matter.
                                                Format (\"KxcsfLabelxgmLabelxwmLabel\").
                                                Examples:
                                                         -c 3x1x2x3 for T1 with K=3, CSF=1, GM=2, WM=3 (default)

                                                         -c 3x1x3x2 for FLAIR with K=3, CSF=1 GM=3, WM=2
                                                         -c 4x4x2x3 uses K=4, CSF=4, GM=2, WM=3

     -f:  Brain extraction registration mask    Mask used for registration to limit the metric computation to
                                                a specific region.

     -k:  Keep temporary files                  Keep brain extraction/segmentation warps, etc (default = 0).

     -q:  Use single floating point precision   Use antsRegistration with single (1) or double (0) floating point precision (default = 0).

     -r:  Initial moving transform              An ITK affine transform (eg, from antsAI or ITK-SNAP) for the moving image.
                                                Without this option, this script calls antsAI to search for a good initial moving
                                                transform.

     -R:  Rotation search parameters            Rotation search parameters for antsAI in format step,arcFraction. The step is in
                                                degrees, the arc fraction goes from 0 (no search) to 1 (search -180 to 180
                                                degree rotations in increements of step). The search begins at -(180*arcFraction)
                                                in each dimension - users should choose parameters so that there is a search point
                                                near zero rotation. Default = 20,0.12.

     -s:  Image file suffix                     Any of the standard ITK IO formats e.g. nrrd, nii.gz, mhd (default = nii.gz)

     -T:  Translation search parameters         Translation search parameters for antsAI in format step,range. The step is in
                                                mm, -range to range will be tested in each dimension. The default does not search
                                                left-right translations because the brain is usually well-centered along this
                                                dimension in human images. Default = 40,0x40x40.

     -u:  Use random seeding                    Use random number generated from system clock (1) or a fixed seed (0). To produce identical
                                                results, multi-threading must also be disabled by setting the environment variable
                                                ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=1. Default = 1.

     -z:  Test / debug mode                     If > 0, runs a faster version of the script. Only for debugging, results will not be good.
