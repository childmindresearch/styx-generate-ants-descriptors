          DiReCT is a registration based estimate of cortical thickness. It was published 
          in S. R. Das, B. B. Avants, M. Grossman, and J. C. Gee, Registration based 
          cortical thickness measurement, Neuroimage 2009, 45:867--879. See also N. J.

          ANTs and FreeSurfer Cortical Thickness Measurements. NeuroImage, 99:166-179, Oct 
          2014. 

OPTIONS: 
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If 
          not specified, DiReCT tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image. 

     -s, --segmentation-image imageFilename
                              [imageFilename,<grayMatterLabel=2>,<whiteMatterLabel=3>]
          A segmentation image must be supplied labeling the grayand white matters. 
          Default values = 2 and 3, respectively. 

     -g, --gray-matter-probability-image imageFilename
          In addition to the segmentation image, a gray matter probability image can be 
          used. If no such image is supplied, one is created using the segmentation image 
          and a variance of 1.0 mm. 

     -w, --white-matter-probability-image imageFilename
          In addition to the segmentation image, a white matter probability image can be 
          used. If no such image is supplied, one is created using the segmentation image 
          and a variance of 1.0 mm. 

     -c, --convergence [<numberOfIterations=45>,<convergenceThreshold=0.0>,<convergenceWindowSize=10>]
          Convergence is determined by fitting a line to the normalized energy profile of 
          the last N iterations (where N is specified by the window size) and determining 
          the slope which is then compared with the convergence threshold. 

     -t, --thickness-prior-estimate thicknessPriorEstimate
          Provides a prior constraint on the final thickness measurement. Default = 10 mm. 

     -a, --thickness-prior-image thicknessPriorFileName
          An image containing spatially varying prior thickness values. 

     -r, --gradient-step stepSize
          Gradient step size for the optimization. Default = 0.025. 

     -l, --smoothing-variance variance
          Defines the Gaussian smoothing of the hit and total images. Default = 1.0 mm. 

     -m, --smoothing-velocity-field-parameter variance
                                              isotropicMeshSpacing
          Defines the Gaussian smoothing of the velocity field (default = 1.5 voxels).If 
          the b-spline smoothing option is chosen, then this defines the isotropic mesh 
          spacing for the smoothing spline (default = 15 mm). 

     -b, --use-bspline-smoothing 1/(0)
          Sets the option for B-spline smoothing of the velocity field.Default = false. 

     -x, --use-masked-smoothing 1/(0)
          Sets the option for masked-based smoothing of the velocity field.Default = 
          false. 

     -q, --time-points 1
          Time points for irregularly spaced time samples and time-variance with which to 
          compute distance metric. The user specifies [0.0x1.2x4.5,3] for input with 3 
          time slices where the vector of numeric value defines the time of sampling e.g. 
          in years and the scalar value (here '3')defines the variance. 

     -e, --restrict-deformation 1/(0)
          Restrict the last dimension's deformation. Meant for use with multiple time 
          points. Default = false. 

     -n, --number-of-integration-points numberOfPoints
          Number of compositions of the diffeomorphism per iteration. Default = 10. 

     -p, --maximum-number-of-invert-displacement-field-iterations numberOfIterations
          Maximum number of iterations for estimating the invert displacement field. 
          Default = 20. 

     -o, --output imageFileName
                  [imageFileName,cumulativeVelocityFieldFileNamePrefix]
          The output consists of a thickness map defined in the segmented gray matter. 

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
          Verbose output. 

     -h 
          Print the help menu (short version). 

     --help 
          Print the help menu.
