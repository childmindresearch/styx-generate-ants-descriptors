Usage: ANTSJacobian ImageDim gWarp outfile uselog maskfn normbytotalbool projectionvector 
 for example 
 ANTSJacobian 3  myWarp.nii   Output  1   templatebrainmask.nii   1 1x0 
 the last 1 normalizes the jacobian by the total in the mask.  use this to adjust for head size. 1x0 will project the warp along direction 1,0 --- don't add this option if you dont want to do this
