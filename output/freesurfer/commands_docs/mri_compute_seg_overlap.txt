NAME
	mri_compute_seg_overlap - compute coefficents of overlap

SYNOPSIS
	mri_compute_seg_overlap [<options>] segvol1 segvol2

DESCRIPTION
	This program compares two segmentation volumes and computes the Dice 
	and Jaccard Coefficients. It considers 12 major structures (label 
	numbers):
	   L/R Hippocampus (17,53)
	   L/R Caudate (11,50)
	   L/R Putamen (12,51)
	   L/R Pallidum (13,52)
	   L/R Amygdala (18,54)
	   L/R Thalamus_Proper (10,49)
	   L/R Lateral_Ventricle (4,43)
	   Third and Fourth Ventricles (14,15)
	   L/R Inf_Lat_Vent (5,44)
	   L/R Cerebral_White_Matter (2,41)
	   L/R Cerebral-Cortex (3,42)
	   L/R Accumbens-area (26,58)
	
	   NOTE! white matter, cortex and accumbens are excluded from the
	   'overall Dice' measure (which is a mean), as the surface-based 
	   wm/gm measures are more accurate (and accumbens is very 
	   difficult to measure).
	
	   Use the --all_labels flag to compute across all labels (not
	   just the structures listed above)
	

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	segvol1
		first segmentation volume

	segvol2
		second segmentation volume

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	None

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-log filename
		log file for individual Dice
		(12 structure pairs, plus mean, std, and 'overall')

	-mlog filename
		log file for mean Dice 

	-slog filename
		log file for std Dice

	-olog
		log file for 'overall' Dice
		(mean excluding wm, gm and accumbens)

	-cortex (0/1)
		if (0/1) is nonzero, exclude cerebral cortex
			  labels from all calculation

	-wm (0/1)
		if (0/1) is nonzero, exclude cerebral white matter
			  labels from all calculation

	-all_labels
		check all labels

	-dice seg1 seg2 ctab ReportEmpty01 ExcludeId datfile tablefile
		Standalone way to compute dice. ctab can = embedded. output = 
		count1 count2 dice fdr tdr

EXAMPLE 1
	mri_compute_seg_overlap manual_seg.mgz aseg.mgz
	
	Used to compare the quality of the automatic segmentation with a 
	manual segmentation.  A Dice of 0.85 is about average. 

REPORTING
	Report bugs to <freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu>

1. Segmentation Index
2. Segmentation Name (if avail)
