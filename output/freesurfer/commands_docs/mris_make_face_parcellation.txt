  surf should be either:
    sphere: units will be approximately equal size within subject but 
            not in correspondence across subjects
    sphere.reg: units will be different sizes within subject but 
            in correspondence across subjects
  Note: do not use inflated as was suggested by previous versions! 
  

This generates a parcellation based on which icosahedral face each vertex maps to.
