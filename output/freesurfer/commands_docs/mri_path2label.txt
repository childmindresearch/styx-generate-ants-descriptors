=== Output of 'mri_path2label --help' ===

  Purpose: Converts a path file to a label or a label file to a path
  file. Attempts to guess the correct format by looking for
  .path and .label suffixes and by looking at the first line in
  the file. Use one of the options to override this behavior.
  Will return an error if it cannot guess a format and none is
  explicitly supplied.

  Multiple paths will be encoded in a label file separated by a
  line with all columns -99999. This is a sentinel dividing lists
  of path points from each other. If the option --single is provided,
  then sentinel values won't be used, and the label file will look
  like a normal label file.

USAGE: /usr/local/freesurfer/bin/mri_path2label [options] input output

   --single : only convert a single path, and don't use sentinel values
   --path2label : will treat input as a path and output a label
   --label2path : will treat input as a label and output a path
   --connect subject hemi : connect path (input and output must be paths)
   --fill subject hemi seedvtx : fill already closed, connected path
      input must be a path, output must be a label
   --confillx surface_fname seedvtx : connect and fill path
      input must be a path, output must be a label
   --confill subject hemi seedvtx : connect and fill path
      input must be a path, output must be a label
   --i source_file : the path file, if path2label
   --o dest_file   : the label file, if path2label
