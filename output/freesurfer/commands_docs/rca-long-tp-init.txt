rca-long-tp-init 7.4.1

rca-long-tp-init - initialize long timepoint subject for recon-all
processing. Mostly, code was just cut out of recon-all, so there are
some things that look funny (eg, longitudinal is explicitly set to 1
and checked eventhough that is what this script does). I wanted to
keep things as consistent as possible with recon-all. While this can
be run outside of recon-all, it is mostly supposed to be run from
within recon-all. It creates its own "local" log file but will append
to log, status, and cmd files if they are passed.
