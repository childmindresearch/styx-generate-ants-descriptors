wfilemask

This program allows the user to zero-out regions of a surface value
file (also known as a .w file) using a label. The user specifies an
input w (with -w) file and a label (with -l). The vertices
corresponding to the label are set to zero, and the result is saved in
a new w file (specified with -o). NOTE: this script requires matlab.
