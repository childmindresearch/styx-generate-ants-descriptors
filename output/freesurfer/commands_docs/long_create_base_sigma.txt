  long_create_base_sigma <base-id> <sigma> [optional params]

  Performs a joint normalization and atlas renormalization at specific
  sigma smoothing level. This is usually done as part of the base stream
  but can be performed to add files for a different sigma level to an
  existing base. 

  Positional parameters:
   <base-id> : subject ID of the base
   <sigma>   : int of sigma smoothing (usually 2..6)
Unmatched '"'.
