This program allows the user to query a Siemens IMA file, 
and can be used to print out a single value from the IMA header 
or to dump lots of info.

DESCRIPTION

A single value can be queried in one of three ways: (1) offset/type, 
(2) key string, (3) attribute name. In the offset method, the user supplies 
an offset which is the number of bytes into the header; the user also supplies  
a type string indicating the data type (short, int, long, float, double, string). 
If a string type is specified, the user must also supply the string length. In  
the key method, the user supplies a key string from a dictionary (see below). 
In the attribute method, the user supplies an attribute name. The difference 
between an attribute and a key is that an attribute may have been interpreted 
in some way (eg, the raw (key-based) row resolution for mosaics is wrong, 
but the attribute is correct). 

A dump of header information can be obtained in two ways. First, if only 
a file name is given, then the dictionary with corresponding values will  
be dumped. If the --fileinfo flag is added, then values that have been  
interpreted are printed out. 

ARGUMENTS

  --i imafile

      Path to the IMA file to be probe. If this is the only option, 
      the dictionary with corresponding values is printed out. See also
      --dictionary.

  --o offset type <stringlen>

      offset is the number of bytes from the beginning of the file. type 
      is the type of data. Valid values are short, int, long, float, double, 
      and string. If string is used, the length of the string must be supplied.

  --d key 

      key is a string as found in the dictionary (see DICTIONARY below).

  --attr attrname

     Name of an attribute.

  --fileinfo 

     Dump the interpreted file information.

  --dictionary

     Dump the dictionary (no ima file name need be supplied). Each entry has
     six columns: entry number, key string, offset, type string, number of 
     bytes in the type, and the string length. If only the imafile is supplied,
     the dictionary will be printed out with the value as a seventh column.

  --ob bstem

     Save pixel data to bstem_000.bshort instead of img_000.bshort

DICTIONARY

The dictionary is a list of character strings (keys) that describe an 
aspect of a value in the IMA header along with its offset, data type,  
and, if a string, the length of the string. The dictionary is unique to 
to this program and does not represent anything official from Siemens 
or anyone else. The key names, offsets, and data types were gleaned from 
other programs and reverse engineering. 

ATTRIBUTES

  isima     : returns 1 if the file is a Siemens IMA file, 0 otherwise 
  studydate : date of the scan  (YYYYMMDD)
  studytime : time of the scan  (HHMMSS)
  voldim    : number of columns, rows, and slices in the volume. 
  volres    : spacing between columns, rows, and slices in the volume
  nframes   : number of frames (expected)
  ismosaic  : returns 1 if slices are mosaiced, 0 otherwise
  nfilesact : actual number of files found for this series
  nfilesexp : number of files expected for this series
  error     : 1 if actual number of files does not equal expected, 0 otherwise
  tr        : repetition time (sec)
  pulseseq  : pulse sequence name
  patname   : patient name 
  patdob    : patient date of birth (YYYYMMDD)
  patgender : patient gender
  pixeldata : stores pixel data as a 2D image in img_000.bshort

BUG REPORTING

Send bug reports to analysis-bugs@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu. Make sure to include
enough information to replicate the problem. This includes, but is not limited
to, the version and command-line.

BUGS

This program does not make use of any 'official' documentation from Siemens. 
As such, some of the results may be wrong. Some of the header elements may or
may not be filled with legitimate values, depending upon how the pulse sequence
was programmed.

The G28_Pre_PixelSize_Row and G28_Pre_PixelSize_Column values are 
incorrect for mosaics. This is actually the way Siemens stores 
these values and is not an bug in  this program.

G20_Rel_Study (3200, long) appears to be the Series Number. There is
another variable (G20_Rel_Series, 3204, long), but this has garbage in
it, at least in the MGH-NMR files.
