This program will add a template into an average surface.

valid options are:

-segment        only use largest connected component of label
-n              normalize output so it can be interpreted as a probability
-orig  <name>   use <name> as original surface position default=orig
-o  <output subject name>   use <output subject> as the space to write the results in instead of the last subject given
-osdir  <output subject dir>   use <output subject dir> as the subjects dir for the output subject'
-sdir  <subjects dir>   use <subject dir> as the subjects dir'
-average_area   compute threshold for label that will give the average label apporximately the average surface area
-s <cond #>     generate summary statistics and write
                them into sigavg<cond #>-<hemi>.w and
                sigvar<cond #>-<hemi>.w.
