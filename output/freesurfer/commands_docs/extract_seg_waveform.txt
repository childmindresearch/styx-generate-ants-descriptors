This program extracts an average waveform from an input volume where
the average is computed over the voxels in the given segmentation
indices. The input volume is mapped to the space of the segmentation
given the registration; if a voxel shift map (VSM) is supply, then
that is applied simultanetously as part of the transform. Nearest
neighbor interpolation is used. Once in the segmentation space, the
voxels in the desired indicies of the segmentation are averaged.
To reduce computational complexity, a bounding box volume around
the segmentation is created. This will yield exactly the same results
as using the full FoV, but does not require mapping fMRI volumes with
100s of time points into the (often) 256^3 segmentation space. 

This method is better than mapping the segmentation into the input
volume space for two reasons: (1) partial volume correction is a
little bit better and no need to specify a fill parameter, and (2) it
can apply the VSM for B0 correction.
