7.4.1


Determines whether two volumes differ. See below for what 
'differ' means. 

The basic usage is something like:

mri_diff vol1 vol2

It then prints to the terminal whether they differ or not.

NOTE: stuff might get printed to the terminal regardless of whether
the volumes are different or not, so you cannot just use the 
presence or absence of terminal output to determine whether they
are different as you can with unix diff.

There are three ways to determine whether they are different:
1. Look for 'volumes differ' in the terminal output
2. Program exits with status > 100
3. Create a log file

To create a log file, add --log yourlogfile any where in the
command line, eg:

mri_diff vol1 vol2 --log yourlogfile

If yourlogfile exists, it will be immediately deleted when the 
program starts. If a difference is detected, yourlogfile will
be created, and information about the difference will be
printed to it. If there is no difference, yourlogfile will
not exist when the program finishes.

Volumes can differ in six ways:
  1. Dimension,               return status = 101
  2. Resolutions,             return status = 102
  3. Acquisition Parameters,  return status = 103
  4. Geometry,                return status = 104
  5. Precision,               return status = 105
  6. Pixel Data,              return status = 106

Dimension is number of rows, cols, slices, and frames.
Resolution is voxel size.
Acqusition parameters are: flip angle, TR, TE, and TI.
Geometry checks the vox2ras matrices for equality.
Precision is int, float, short, etc.

By default, all of these are checked, but some can be turned off
with certain command-line flags:

--notallow-res  : turns off resolution checking
--notallow-acq  : turns off acquistion parameter checking
--notallow-geo  : turns off geometry checking
--notallow-prec : turns off precision checking
--notallow-pix  : turns off pixel checking

In addition, the minimum difference in pixel value required
to be considered different can be controlled with --thresh.
Eg, if two volumes differ by .00001, and you do not consider
this to be significant, then --thresh .00002 will prevent
that difference from being considered different. The default
threshold is 0.

--diff diffvol

Saves difference image to diffvol.

QUALITY ASSURANCE

mri_diff can be used to check that two volumes where acquired in the
same way with the --qa flag. This turns on Res, Acq, and Prec, and
turns off Geo and Pix. Instead of checking geometry, it checks for the
basic orientation of the volumes (eg, RAS, LPI, etc). The idea here is
that the pixel data and exact geometry may be different, but other
things should be the same.

EXIT STATUS

0   Volumes are not different and there were no errors
1   Errors encounted. Volumes may or may not be different
101 Volumes differ in dimension
102 Volumes differ in resolution
103 Volumes differ in acquisition parameters
104 Volumes differ in geometry
105 Volumes differ in precision
106 Volumes differ in pixel data
107 Volumes differ in orientation
