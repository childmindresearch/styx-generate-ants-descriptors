dcmsplit 7.4.1

The purpose of this progam is to separate dicom files into separate
folders based on a unique identifier (UID). This is useful when
multiple subjects or studies are mixed in one folder in which case
dcmunpack will no work properly. Each UID will get its own folder in
the output directory. Once this program is run, then dcmunpack can be
run on the output as normal.

By default, the UID is the Study UID (dicom tag 20 d) but it can be
changed to Patient Name (tag 10 10) with --name, Series Number with
--seriesno or some other tag with --t group element.  

If --series+ is used, then the folder will be UID/SeriesNo. This can
be used to prevent name collisions.

By default, all the files for a given UID will by symlinked to 
a file of the same name in the folder for that UID. The files 
can be copied instead with --cp.

Any file that causes mri_probedicom to exit with error is ignored. 

If dcmdir has a space anywhere in its path (going back to root),
then the program will exit with error.
