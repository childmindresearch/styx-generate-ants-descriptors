USAGE: mri_mergelabels

   -i label1 -i label2 ...
   -o outputlabel
   -d dir : all labels in directory dir

This is a simple script that will merge two or more label
files. It does this by catting the label files together
(after removing the first two lines). It inserts a new
header (the first two lines). The number of entries in
the new file (ie, the number on the second line), is 
computed by summing those from the input files.
