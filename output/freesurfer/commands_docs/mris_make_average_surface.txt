  Run with -help for more info

  This program will average the orig surfaces from the given subject
  list into a single surface using Talairach coords and the spherical
  transform.  The cooridinates of the vertices are the average of the
  talairach coordinates (as defined by mri/transforms/talairach.xfm)
  of the vertices from the input subjects.  The results will be saved
  in a the specified subject's directory.  This default behavior can
  be changed with option flags.

  The user must supply at least 4 arguments, plus subject list:

  mris_make_average_surface [options] hemi outsurfname cansurfname outsubject 
    subj1 subj2 subj3 ...

  hemi - hemisphere,  lh or rh
  outsurfname - output surface name (eg, avg_orig)
  cansurfname - registration surface (eg, sphere.reg)
  outsubject  - name of subject to store the results in

  OPTIONS

  -help 

  Print help and exit.

  -version

  Print version and exit

  -sdir sdir

  Use sdir instead of SUBJECTS_DIR

  -sdir-out sdirout

  Save results in sdirout/outsubject instead of SUBJECTS_IDR/outsubject.

  -nonorm

  Do not normalize area

  -i icoorder

  Use given icosahedron order (default is 7)

  -x xfmname

  Use transforms/xfmname instead of talairach.xfm

  -t templatename

  Volume to use as geometry template for output surfaces

  -s surfname
  Use surfname instead of orig

-surf2surf, -no-surf2surf
  Use (don't use) surf2surf transform instead of parametric surface.
  The parametric surface often creates large faces near the poles.

-simple avgsurf surf1 surf2 ...
  Stand-alone option to compute an average surface from the list.
  All surfaces must have same number of vertices 

  -v diagno

  Set Gdiag_no = diagno
