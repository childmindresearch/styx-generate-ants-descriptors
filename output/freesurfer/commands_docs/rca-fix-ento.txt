Note: this program is a temporary fix for FS version 7.3 and earlier. For
later versions, you can run recon-all with -fix-ento-wm.

This program attempts to fix the entorhinal white matter in
FreeSurfer.  Typically, this WM is very thin and often not visible;
consequently, the white and pial surfaces are generally not
accurate. This script will segment the WM around ento using a deep
learning network. The output will be subject/mri/entowm.mgz. This
segmentation differentiates between the generic WM around ento and the
WM in gyrus ambiens (GA). The WM in GA is the most problematic. This
sementation is then used to edit wm.mgz and
brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz.  For wm.mgz, it adds the ento WM as 255
to make it look like manual edits. For brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz,
it will set the GA WM to 255 so that looks like a manual edit. If
brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz does not exist, then it is created from
brain.finalsurfs.mgz and the manedit is edited with entowm. If
brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz does exist, then it copies it to
backup.brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz and then edits
brain.finalsurfs.manedit.mgz. Existing edits in manedit will be kept
unless they conflict with the entowm edits. This scripts uses a deep
learning model that may require as much as 20GB (GPU not needed).
