NAME
	mri_mask - applies a mask volume (typically skull stripped)

SYNOPSIS
	mri_mask [options] <in vol> <mask vol> <out vol>

DESCRIPTION
	This program applies a mask volume (typically skull stripped).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	in vol
		input volume

	mask vol
		mask volume

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-xform %s
		apply M3Z/LTA to transform mask to space of input volume (can 
		be identity.nofile, will be inverted if needed)

	-lta_src %s
		source volume for -xform (if not available from the xform 
		file)

	-lta_dst %s
		target volume for -xform (if not available from the xform 
		file)

	-T threshold
		threshold mask volume at threshold (i.e., all values <= T 
		considered as zero)

	-samseg
		assume mask is a samseg segmentation and mask all non-brain 
		labels

	-bb npad
		Create and extract data from a bounding box around the mask. 
		The bounding box is expanded by npad voxels in each direction.
		npad should be at least 1 to avoid clipping

	-bbm npad1 npad2 npad3
		Create and extract data from a bounding box around the mask. 
		The bounding box is expanded by npad[X] voxels in each 
		direction. npad should be at least 1 to avoid clipping

	-bbmm npad1a npad1b npad2a npad2b npad3a npad3b
		Create and extract data from a bounding box around the mask. 
		The bounding box is expanded by npad[X] voxels in each 
		direction. npad should be at least 1 to avoid clipping

	-abs
		take abs() before applying threshold

	-invert, -no-invert
		Invert mask (or turn off inversion)

	-rh
		set mask in rh labels to 1 (assumes input mask is an aseg)

	-lh
		set mask in lh labels to 1 (assumes input mask is an aseg)

	-dilate N
		dilate mask N times before applying

	-no_cerebellum
		remove cerebellum from aseg mask (assumes input mask is an 
		aseg)

	-oval #
		use oval as output instead of 0

	-transfer #
		transfer only voxel value # from mask to out

	-keep_mask_deletion_edits
		transfer voxel-deletion edits (voxels=1) from mask to out vol

OUTPUTS
	out vol
		output volume
