Scans a DICOM directory and extracts information about each series.
The files in the directory must conform to the following naming
convention:

        NNNNNN-S-MMMMM.dcm

where NNNNNN and MMMMM are any strings of any length as long as thay
do not contain dashes (-). S is the series/run number. This is the
naming convention of the data at MGH after being pushed from the scanner
to the network archive. This function will not work on data burned to
CD from the scanner.  Example: 953000-2-9.dcm

This function is considerably faster than using unpacksdcmdir with
the -scanonly option, but it does require that the files be named
appropriately.

The output is a list of series/runs with the pulse sequence, 
protocol, and file name from the series. The Patient Name, Study Date,
and Study Time are echo also printed out.

If an unpackdir is given, the the dicom files are converted to mgz 
format with the following name: sequencename_runR.mgz, where R is the 
run number.
