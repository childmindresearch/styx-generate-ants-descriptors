example1:
  Assuming the subjects to test are listed in the SUBJECTS var
  declared in the scripts/subjects.csh file, and that
  each of these subjects has a surf/?h.sphere.reg and a manually
  edited file named surf/?h.aparc_edited.annot, and there exists
  a color LUT named scripts/colortable_final.txt, then the
  following command will perform a jackknife accuracy test: 

  parc_atlas_jackknife_test -all

  The test is conducted as follows: Given a set of N manually 
  labeled subjects, N atlases trained on N-1 number of subjects 
  are created, and the one excluded subject is used to test the
  accuracy of this atlas, based on the Dice coefficient(s).
  The overall classifier accuracy is the mean of all the results.
  The results are written to the directory named 'jackknife'.
