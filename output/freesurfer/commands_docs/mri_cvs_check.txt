Checks whether the files that are required for mri_cvs_register all exist.
Set SUBJECTS_DIR properly before calling this script!

Required Arguments:

--mov subjid

Subject id of the subject (as found in SUBJECTS_DIR) whose scan is to 
be moved in registration with that of the template. 

--template subjid

Subject id of the subject (as found in SUBJECTS_DIR) whose scan is to 
be used and the template / target for the registration. If missing, CVS 
template is assumed as a target and no checks are done.
