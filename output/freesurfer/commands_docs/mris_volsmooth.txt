mris_volsmooth 7.4.1

Performs surface-based smoothing inside a volume. This is just a
front-end for a series of programs which will sample a volume to a
surface, smooth on the surface, then replace the surface voxels in the
volume with values that were smoothed on the surface. This can make it
convenient for interfacing volume-based functional analysis tools with
surface-based smoothing. When complete, values not on the surface will
be the same as in the input volume. Both hemispheres are
smoothed. Areas outside of the ?h.cortex.label are not smoothed.  One
can optionally smooth non-surface voxels in the volume with

--i invol

Input volume with values that will be smoothed on the surface.

--o outvol

Duh.

--reg volreg

tkregister-style registration matrix that maps between the input/output
volumes and the FreeSurfer surface anatomical. See tkregister2.

--projfrac frac

When sampling to/from the surface, project along the surface normal
an amount equal to frac*thickeness at each vertex. See mri_vol2surf.
Default is 0.5 (ie, half way into the ribbon).

--projfrac-avg min max delta

Same idea as --projfrac, but sample at each of the points between min
and max at a spacing of delta. The samples are then averaged
together. The idea here is to average along the normal. Eg,
--projfrac-avg 0 1 .1 will sample along the normal between the white
(0) and pial (1) every 10% for a total of 11 samples. These will then
be averaged together. The values are then projected back into the
surface with --projfrac 0.5.

--fwhm fwhm

Smooth on the surface by full-width/half-max in mm. See also --niters.

--niters niters

Specify surface smoothing by number of nearest neighbor smoothing
iterations instead of fwhm.

--vol-fwhm volfwhm

Smooth in the volume. In this case, the surface voxels and non-surface 
voxels are smoothed entirely seprately (ie, surface voxels are only 
smoothed with other surface voxels and non-surface voxels are only 
smoothed with other non-surface voxels).
