cp-dicom 7.4.1


Copies dicom files into separate directories for each series. The
series number is extracted from the dicom header, so the dicom file
names do not have to conformm to any standard.

Example:

  cp-dicom -d ./dicomdir -o /space/data/mydicom

All the dicom files should be in ./dicomdir.  The results will be in
/space/data/mydicom/protocol-S, where "protocol" is the protocol name
and S is the series number. There will be a separate directory for
each series. The dicom file names will not be changed. If the protocol
cannot be found in the dicom header, then only the series number is
used for the directory name.

The series number is based on DICOM tag 20 11.
The protocol is based on DICOM tag 18 1030.

Note: any spaces or asterices (*) are removed from the protocol name.
