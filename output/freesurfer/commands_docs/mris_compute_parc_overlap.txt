Compares two parcellated (annotated or labeled) surfaces
and computes an overall Dice coefficient
and mean minimum distances (mm).

Usage:
  mris_compute_parc_overlap --s subject --hemi hemi \ 
    --annot1 annotfile --annot2 annotfile

Required:
  --s subject              subject to check
  --hemi hemi              hemisphere: rh or lh
  and:
    --annot1 annotfile     first .annot file
    --annot2 annotfile     second .annot file
  or:
    --label1 labelfile     first .label file
    --label2 labelfile     second .label file

Optional:
  --sd subj_dir            set SUBJECTS_DIR
  --log filename           output the overall DICE and min dist to filename
  --label-list file        file containing labels to 
                           check, one per line  --nocheck-label1-xyz     when loading label1 file, don't
                           check x,y,z coords to surface
                           default: check x,y,x
  --nocheck-label2-xyz     ditto for label2
  --nocheck-label-xyz      do not check label1 and label2
  --use-label1-xyz         replace surface x,y,z coords
                           with those in label1 file
  --use-label2-xyz         ditto for label2
  --use-label-xyz          use label1 and label2 coords
  --debug-overlap          generate ?h.overlap.annot

Example 1:
  mris_compute_parc_overlap --s bert --hemi lh \
    --annot1 aparc --annot2 aparc.ernie

In this example, the annotation file named lh.aparc.annot, which is
created by the utility mris_ca_label (executed during the -autorecon3
stage of recon-all), is compared against the annotation file named 
lh.aparc.ernie.annot.  This second annotation file is created by the
utility mri_surf2surf, which resamples one surface onto another. This
resampling is necessary so that a vertex-by-vertex comparison is
meaningful.  An example command-line is: 
  mri_surf2surf --srcsubject ernie --trgsubject bert --hemi lh \ 
    --sval-annot $SUBJECTS_DIR/ernie/label/lh.aparc.annot \ 
    --tval       $SUBJECTS_DIR/bert/label/lh.ernie.aparc.annot

Note that the resampling output file, lh.ernie.annot, is deposited
in the label directory of the subject (bert) supplied as the input
to the mris_compute_parc_overlap utility.  Supply --help to
mri_surf2surf for its usage information.

There are two measures output by mris_compute_parc_overlap: an overall
Dice coefficient, and a table of mean minimum distances between 
corresponding labels. A Dice value of 1 indicates perfect overlap.
A mean minimum distance of 0 (mm) indicates perfect overlap.

If --debug-overlap is specified, a file called ?h.overlap.annot is 
created in the subjects label directory, and is a copy of the annot2
input, except wherever the labels are identical with annot1, that label
is replaced with the label 'unknown', thus leaving any mismatches
labeled as they were in the annot2 file.  If the Dice coefficient is 
less than 1, then this ile is a way to visualize the mismatches, 
which are typically around the label borders.

Example 2:
  mris_compute_parc_overlap --s bert --hemi lh \
    --label1 precentral --label2 precentral

In this example, two label files are specified.  Just those two
labels are compared.

When comparing the labels at two vertices, the following labels are
excluded from measurements if both vertices have the same label:
  unknown
  corpuscallosum
  Unknown
  Corpus_callosum
