reg-mni305.2mm 7.4.1

Computes the registration between the FreeSurfer MNI305 2mm space and
a subject's FreeSurfer anatomical space. This is completely dependent
on the talairach.xfm file and should only take a few seconds to run.

regfile is a tkregister2-style registration matrix (should have a .dat
or .reg extension).

This registration can be used to view mni305 2mm results as produced
by FS-FAST in a subject's native anatomical.

The FreeSurfer MNI305 2mm space is that defined by:

$FREESURFER_HOME/average/mni305.cor.subfov2.mgz

To check, run

tkregister2 --reg regfile --mov $FREESURFER_HOME/average/mni305.cor.subfov2.mgz

This should be no better or worse than the FreeSurfer taliarach registration 
as seen by

tkregister2 --s subject --fstal
