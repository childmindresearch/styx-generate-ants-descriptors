Usage: 
Converts a track overall stats file created by tracula 
into a table which is used for group statistics.

For a given tract, the table might contain subjects as rows and overall
statistics of the tract as columns. Or for a given tract and a measure,
the table might contain subjects vs byvoxel measures such as FA along the tract

Hence tractstats2table has two modes of operation -- one for overall
tract statistics ( --overall option ) and one for byvoxel statistics 
( --byvoxel option ). Once one of these is specified, 

The input consists of a set of path.stats files and can be spec'ed in
one of the following ways:
  1. Specify each input file after -i 

          -i subject1/stats/pathstats.overall.txt -i subject2/stat/pathstats.overall.txt ..
  
  2. Specify all the input stat files after --inputs. --inputs does not have
     to be the last argument. Eg:
       
          --inputs subject1/stats/pathstats.overall.txt subject2/stat/pathstats.overall.txt ..

  3. Specify a file which contains all the stats files ( one per line )

          --load-pathstats-from-file <filename>

Note that the first two and the last are mutually exclusive. i.e
don't specify --inputs when you are providing --load-pathstats-from-file and vice versa.

The --overall option includes two optional options --only-measures and --exclude-measures.
The first option outputs only the measures requested in order. The second option excludes 
the measures specified. ( The measures spec-ed have to be in the .stats file )

The --byvoxel option needs a required option of what measure we are interested in. One of 
AD, RD, MD and FA. This is specified using --byvoxel-measure option. 

The --transpose flag writes the transpose of the table. 
This might be a useful way to see the table when the number of subjects is
relatively less than the number of segmentations.

The --delimiter option controls what character comes between the measures
in the table. Valid options are 'tab' ( default), 'space', 'comma' and  'semicolon'.

The -v or --debug option increases the verbosity in case of something going wrong.

Example Invocation:
    
    tractstats2table --load-pathstats-from-file=$HOME/pathfiles.txt -o     --only-measures FA_Avg Count --tablefile overall.tab

This takes all the pathstats.overall.txt specified in $HOME/pathfiles.txt and outputs
only the overall measures FA_Avg and Count of the possible measures to the output file
overall.tab

    tractstats2table --inputs bert/dpath/pathstats.byvoxel.txt             fsaverage/dpath/pathstats.byvoxel.txt -b --byvoxel-measure FA            --tablefile byvoxel.tab

This takes the two input byvoxel statsfiles specified using the --inputs option and 
writes the FA along the length of the pathway for both the inputs.

  --byvoxel-measure=BYVOXEL_MEASURE
                         (REQUIRED with --byvoxel) specify byvox measure. one
                        of [AD, RD, MD, FA]
  -t OUTPUTFILE, --tablefile=OUTPUTFILE
                        (REQUIRED) the output tablefile
  -d DELIMITER, --delimiter=DELIMITER
                        delimiter between measures in the table. default is
                        tab (alt comma, space, semicolon )
  --transpose           transpose the table ( default is subject in rows and
                        measures/count in cols)
