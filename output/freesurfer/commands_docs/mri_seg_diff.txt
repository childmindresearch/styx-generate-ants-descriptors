  This program computes and merges differences in segmentation volumes
  (eg, aseg.auto.mgz and aseg.mgz) primarily for the purpose of
  managing manual edits to aseg.mgz. 

  When computing a difference, it compares seg1 to seg2 at each
  voxel. If they are the same, then the diff volume voxel gets a value
  of 256 (Voxel-Unchanged in FreeSurferColorLUT.txt). If they are
  different, then it takes the value of seg2. The diff seg can be
  loaded as a segmentation in tkmedit. If there is no difference,
  then the difference volume will not be written unless you use
  --diff-force.

  When merging a difference, a voxel in the merged seg will take the
  value of the input seg if the diff-in has a value of 256. If the
  diff-in value is something other than 256, then the merged value
  will be the diff-in value.

  EXAMPLES:

  # Determine manual edits 
  mri_seg_diff --seg1 aseg.auto.mgz --seg2 aseg.mgz --diff aseg.manedits.mgz

  # Merge manual edits 
  mri_seg_diff --seg aseg.auto.mgz --merged aseg.mgz --diff-in aseg.manedits.mgz
