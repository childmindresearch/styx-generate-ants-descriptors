Version: biasfield 7.4.1

Computes the bias field by dividing the (unconformed) orig.mgz by the
norm.mgz.  The bias field is smoothed by 10mm FWHM to remove anatomy.
The bias field is normalized so that the mean bias field in the
central corpus callosum is 1. The output is a file called
biasfield.mgz in the subject mri dir. Also creates a file called
rawavg.cor.norm.mgz, which is the rawavg.mgz in 256^3, 1mm^3 space
with the bias field removed (note that this is not fully conformed).

NOTE: this cannot be run if the rawavg.mgz is already conformed or
if the inputs (001.mgz, etc) have been conformed.
