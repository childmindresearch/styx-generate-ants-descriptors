NAME
	mri_ms_fitparms

SYNOPSIS
	mri_ms_fitparms [options] [vol_1] [vol_2] ... [output_dir]

DESCRIPTION
	This program takes up to 500 FLASH images as input, and estimates the 
	T1 and PD values of the data for voxel, as well as a linear transform 
	aligning each of the images. The T1 and PD maps are written into 
	[output_dir] together with synthetic volumes names vol?.mgz, one for 
	each of the input volumes. All the output volumes are generated in the
	common (motion-corrected) space. Note that TR, TE and the flip angle 
	are read directly from the image header. If this information is not 
	available, it can be specified on the command line using -tr [TR in 
	msec] -te [TE in msec] -fa [flip angle in degrees] before each volume.
	Use -at [xform file name] or -ait [xform file name] to specify 
	transformation for each individual volume. Note only one for each 
	flip-angle is enough. -at will apply the transform to the following 
	volume to align with others.
	
	Interpolation method.  Default is trilinear, other options are 
	nearest, sinc.  You can say -foo or -interp foo.  For sinc, you can 
	say -interp sinc 3 or -interp sinc -hw 3 or -sinc 3 or -sinc -hw 3.  
	Maybe -hw 3 should imply sinc, but right now it doesn't.
