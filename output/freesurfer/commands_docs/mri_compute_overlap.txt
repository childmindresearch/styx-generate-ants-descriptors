mri_compute_overlap

Computes three different types of overlap measures either for all the existing labels
in the input volumes or a subset of them that the users lists in the command line. The
three overlap measures are the following: 
(1) `volume difference` = 2*|A|-|B|/|A|+|B|
(2) `volume overlap (Dice)`    = 2*|AB|/|A|+|B|; the intersection over the mean of the segmentation volumes
(3) `volume overlap (Jaccard)` = |AB|/|A+B|; the intersection over the union of the segmentation volumes


usage: /usr/local/freesurfer/bin/mri_compute_overlap [options] <volume 1> <volume 2> ... <volume N> [label numbers]

Options:
  -a		compute overlap of all labels (if missing, labels of interest should be listed)
  -s		show label name for segmentation
  -total	compute the total overlap (# of voxels that are the same)
  -nosummary	not computing total label summary
  -mask <vol>	limit the domain of the calculation to the nonzero voxels in <vol>
  -l <fname>	filename to write results to
  -q		do not display results on std display (default is false; if -l is used, this option is set)
  -t <l1>  <l2>	translating label l1 to label l2
  -h		print help
