NAME
	mri_watershed

SYNOPSIS
	mri_watershed [<options>] invol outvol

DESCRIPTION
	This program strips skull and other outer non-brain tissue and 
	produces the brain volume from T1 volume or the scanned volume.
	
	The "watershed" segmentation algorithm was used to dertermine the 
	intensity values for white matter, grey matter, and CSF. 
	A force field was then used to fit a spherical surface to the brain. 
	The shape of the surface fit was then evaluated against a previously 
	derived template. 
	
	If you used -atlas option, then { The template was used to correct the
	surface. }
	
	The finely grained sphere was fit to the brain.
	
	The default parameters are: -w 0.82 -b 0.32 -h 10 -seedpt -ta -wta 
	
	You can use one of the first five flags to change these default 
	parms.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	None

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-w weight
		preweight the input image using atlas information (no_w -> 1)

	-no_wta
		dont use the preweighting fot the template deformation

	-b proba_merging
		use the basins merging using atlas information (no_b -> 1)

		dont use (template deformation using atlas information)

	-copy
		Just copy input to output, ignore other options

	-atlas
		use the atlas information to correct the segmentation. When 
		the segmented brain is not correct, this option might help 
		you.

	-surf [surfname]
		save the BEM surfaces.In order to get the surfaces consistent 
		with tkmedit, you have to use the option -useSRAS.

	-useSRAS
		use the surface RAS coordinates (not the scanner RAS) for 
		surfaces.

	-noT1
		don't do T1 analysis. (Useful when running out of memory)

	-less
		shrink the surface

	-more
		expand the surface

	-wat
		use only the watershed algorithm

	-T1
		specify T1 input volume (T1 grey value = 110)

	-wat+temp
		watershed algo and first template smoothing

	-first_temp
		use only the first template smoothing + local matching

	-surf_debug
		visualize the surfaces onto the output volume

	-brainsurf [surfname]
		save the brain surface

	-shk_br_surf [int_h surfname]
		to save the brain surface shrank inward of int_h mm

	-s [int_i int_j int_k]
		add a seed point

	-c [int_i int_j int_k]
		specify the center of the brain (in voxel unit)

	-r int_r
		specify the radius of the brain (in voxel unit)

	-t int_threshold
		change the threshold in the watershed analyze process

	-h int_hpf
		precize the preflooding height (in percent)

	-n
		not use the watershed analyze process

	-LABEL
		labelize the output volume into scalp, skull, csf, gray and 
		white

	-man [int_csf int_trn int_gray]
		to change the different parameters csf_max, transition_
		intensity and GM_intensity

	-xthresh xthresh
		Remove voxels whose intensity exceeds xthresh

	-mask
		mask a volume with the brain mask

	--help
		show usage message

	--version
		show the current version

OUTPUTS
	brainvol
		skull stripped brain volume

	BEMsurfaces
		when you specify the option -brainsurf surfname

EXAMPLE 1
	mri-watershed -atlas T1 brain
	
	where T1 is the T1 volume and brain is the output brain volume. When 
	the cerebellum is cut-off from the brain or getting the left/right 
	asymmetric brain, you should first try this -atlas option.

EXAMPLE 2
	mri-watershed T1 brain
	
	The same as the first example, but no correction is applied to the 
	intermediate result.
