Usage:
-----
mri_create_t2combined subjid t1wb t2upper t2middle t2lower t2combined [show]

Inputs:
------
subjid   - subject id of the freesurfer anatomical
t1wb     - T1 7T whole-brain
t2upper  - T2* 7T partial-brain upper half
t2middle - T2* 7T partial-brain middle half, or enter none
t2lower  - T2* 7T partial-brain lower half

Outputs:
-------
t2combined - T2* 7T combined partial-brain halves
A logfile named /root/mri_create_t2combined.log is generated.

Option:
------
show - if the last argument is 'show', then the commands
       that will run are shown, but not executed.

Example:
-------
mri_create_t2combined bert t1-7t.nii.gz t2upper.nii.gz none t2lower.nii.gz t2combined.nii.gz

The purpose of this utility is to combine two (or three) T2* 7T partial-
brain volumes into one volume, retaining the resolution, and
registered to mprage anatomical, such that surfaces can be overlayed.
To do this requires: 1. anatomical data processed by Freesurfer;
2. 7T T1-weighted scan taken in the same session as the 7T T2*-weighted
scans; and 3. set of 7T T2*-weighted upper, [middle] and lower brain scans.

tkregister2 is run during this script.  When it appears, the 
registration should be inspected, and the Save Reg button pressed to
save the registration. Then exit tkregister2 to continue the script.
