wmedits2surf 7.4.1

This program computes binary maps of surface locations near where the
wm.mgz has been edited. It creates two files for each hemisphere,
one for each type of edit. These will be

subject/surf/lh.wmerase.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/rh.wmerase.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/lh.wmfill.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/rh.wmfill.fsa.mgh

These are binary masks on fsaverage space. They can be concatenated
together to make maps of the likelyhood that a given spatial location
is affected by a white matter edit.

It will also create 
  subject/stats/wm.erase.dat
  subject/stats/wm.fill.dat
The first number will be the number of voxels cloned/edited
