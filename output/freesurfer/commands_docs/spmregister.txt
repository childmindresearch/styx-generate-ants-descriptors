USAGE: spmregister

Required Arguments:
   --s subjid   or  --fsvol full/path/to.mgz 
   --mov volid  : input/movable volume
   --reg register.dat

Optional Arguments
   --frame frameno : reg to frameno (default 0=1st)
   --mid-frame : reg to middle frame (not with --frame)
   --template-out template : save template (good with --frame)
   --fsvol volid : use FreeSurfer volid (default brainmask)
   --force-ras : force input geometry to be RAS
   --o outvol : resample mov and save as outvol

   --tmp tmpdir  : temporary dir (implies --nocleanup)
   --nocleanup  : do not delete temporary files
   --version : print version and exit
   --help    : print help and exit


Registers a volume to its FreeSurfer anatomical using SPMs spm_coreg
with Normalised Mutual Information and creates a FreeSurfer
register.dat file. Does not resample. Requires matlab and SPM (should
work with either spm2 or spm5). The registration is rigid (ie, 6 DOF).

--s subjid

Id of the subject as found in SUBJECTS_DIR. The reference volume is
the mri/brain volume (this can be changed with --fsvol). This is
converted to analyze using mri_convert.

--mov volid

Volume identifier of the movable volume. This must be specified in
a way suitable for mri_convert. Uses first frame unless --frame
is specified. For this to work correctly, the movable volume must
have correct geometry information (eg, a valid SPM-style .mat file)
otherwise the results may be unpredictable.

--reg regfile

Output registration file. This will map RAS in the reference to
RAS in the movable. This file/matrix is in a format understood
by freesurfer (see tkregister2 --help for docs). It will contain
the subjectname.

--frame frameno

Use something other than the first frame. Eg, FSL uses the the middle
frame (see --mid-frame). For SPM analyze, you should specify the file
that corresonds to the frame you want because each file only has one
frame.

--mid-frame

Use the middle frame of the mov volume as the template.

--template-out template

Save the mov template. Good when template is something other than
the first frame of the mov volume.

--force-ras

Force input geometry to be RAS. This was designed to be used when
registering SPM2 spatially normalized (affine) volumes. Eg, when
data is registered to spm2/templates/EPI.mnc, SPM will not write
a .mat file with the normalized volume (which will be RAS). But
without a .mat file, the assumption is that the volume will be
LAS.

--matlab path-to-matlab-binary

Use the given matlab binary instead of the PATH default. This can be
handy if your default matlab version is incompatable with SPM. Note:
you can also set the FS_SPMREG_MATLAB environment variable to point
to path-to-matlab-binary. Eg: 

    --matlab /usr/pubsw/common/matlab/7.0.1/bin/matlab
    setenv FS_SPMREG_MATLAB /usr/pubsw/common/matlab/7.0.1/bin/matlab

NOTES:

Uses normalized mutual information.

BUGS

There may be a series of warnings of the form:
"Warning: Assuming a scalefactor of 1 for refvol.spm_rigid_register.nii".
This can be ignored.

The movable volume needs to have "valid" geometry (eg, SPM-style .mat
file). "Valid" means that the direction cosines roughly identify
Right, Anterior, and Superior (though they do not need to be perfectly
correct).

This script executes matlab, and errors inside matlab are often hard
to catch and report properly. If matlab fails with an error that is
not caught, and registration file will still be created based on the
header geometry information. This may look like a correct registration
if the anatomical and functional were acquired during the same session.
