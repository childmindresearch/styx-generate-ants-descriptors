USAGE: trac-all

Using a configuration file to set analysis options:
  -c <file> : dmrirc file (see dmrirc.example)

Using only mandatory inputs with all default options:
  -s <subjectname> : subject name (if not defined in dmrirc)
  -i <file> : input DWI DICOM (if not defined in dmrirc)

Choosing which part of the analysis to do:
  -prep     : do pre-processing (step 1, all substeps)
  -bedp     : do bedpost (step 2)
  -path     : do pathway reconstruction (step 3)
  -stat     : assemble pathway measures from multiple subjects (step 4)

Performing a part of the preprocessing or skipping a part:
  -corr     : do image corrections (step 1.1)
  -nocorr   : don't do step 1.1
  -qa       : do image quality assessment (step 1.2)
  -noqa     : don't do step 1.2
  -intra    : do intra-subject registration (step 1.3)
  -nointra  : don't do step 1.3
  -tensor   : do tensor fit (step 1.4)
  -notensor : don't do step 1.4
  -inter    : do inter-subject registration (step 1.5)
  -nointer  : don't do step 1.5
  -prior    : do pathway priors (step 1.6)
  -noprior  : don't do step 1.6

Analysis steps:
  1. Pre-processing
     1.1 Image corrections (eddy-current and/or B0)
     1.2 Image quality assessment (head motion measures)
     1.3 Intra-subject registration (individual DWI to individual T1)
     1.4 Tensor fit
     1.5 Inter-subject registration (individual DWI/T1 to template)
     1.6 Pathway priors from atlas and T1
  2. Stick-and-ball model fitting with bedpost
  3. Pathway reconstruction
  4. Assemble pathway measures from all subjects

Other options:
  -infant         : use infant brain processing options
  -jobs <file>    : write a text file with command lines that can be
                    run in parallel but do not run them - the user can
                    then submit each line as a job on a compute cluster
  -log <file>     : unique log file instead of scripts/trac-all.log
  -noappendlog    : overwrite old log files instead of appending
  -cmd <file>     : unique cmd file instead of scripts/trac-all.cmd
  -no-isrunning   : do not check whether subjects are currently being processed

  -umask umask    : set unix file permission mask (default 002)
  -grp groupid    : check that current group is alpha groupid 
  -allowcoredump  : set coredump limit to unlimited
  -debug          : generate much more output
  -dontrun        : do everything but execute each command
  -onlyversions   : print version of each binary and exit
  -version        : print version of this script and exit
  -help           : print full contents of help

trac-all 7.4.1


Recostruct white-matter pathways using an atlas of the underlying anatomy.

BASIC USAGE
There are two ways to use this script.

> Using only mandatory inputs with all default options:
  trac-all -{prep,bedp,path,stat} -subject subjectname -i dicomfile

> Using a file called dmrirc to define custom options:
  trac-all -{prep,bedp,path,stat} -c dmrirc

If a dmrirc file is not specified, then the subject name and input DWI
DICOM must be specified on the command line. If a dmrirc file is specified,
then the options set in that file override any corresponding command line
options.

STEP-WISE DIRECTIVES
Any of the two basic forms of usage described above must include an
argument (-prep for pre-processing, -bedp for bedpost, -path for path
reconstruction, or -stat for group tables) that specifies which part of
the analysis to perform. The four parts must be performed in that order.

It is also possible to perform a certain step of the pre-processing
(with -stepname) or to skip a certain step from the pre-processing (with
-nostepname). The default pre-processing performs all steps.

If there are conflicting step-wise arguments, the ones that come later
in the command line override the ones that come earlier.

Various aspects of each processing step can be configured in the dmrirc
file. See example configuration files ($FREESURFER_HOME/bin/dmrirc.*) for
more details:
  dmrirc.example : Single session, single DWI scan per session
  dmrirc.multiscan.example : Single session, multiple DWI scans per session
  dmrirc.long.example : Multiple sessions, single DWI scan per session
  dmrirc.long.multiscan.example : Multiple sessions, multiple DWI scans per session

> Step 1: Pre-processing
          -prep to do this step

  Pre-processing includes steps 1.1 through 1.6 below.

> Step 1.1: Image corrections
            -corr to do this step, -nocorr to skip this step

  Eddy current and susceptibility distortion correction.

> Step 1.2: Image quality assessment
            -qa to do this step, -noqa to skip this step

  Estimation of between-volume and within-volume head motion.

> Step 1.3: Intra-subject registration
            -intra to do this step, -nointra to skip this step

  Individual DWI-to-T1 registration.

> Step 1.4: Tensor fit
            -tensor to do this step, -notensor to skip this step

  Tensor model fitting on DWIs.

> Step 1.5: Inter-subject registration
            -inter to do this step, -nointer to skip this step

  Individual-to-template registration, affine or nonlinear, T1- or DWI-based.

> Step 1.6: Pathway priors
            -prior to do this step, -noprior to skip this step

  Combine training data and subject's own data to generate pathway priors.

> Step 2: Bedpost (cluster highly recommended for this step)
          -bedp to do this step

  Ball-and-stick model fitting on DWIs with bedpostx.

> Step 3: Pathway reconstruction
          -path to do this step

  Do the actual tractography.

> Step 4: Assemble pathway measures from multiple subjects
          -stat to do this step

  Combine whole-path or along-the-path measures (anisotropy and 
  diffusivity) from multiple subjects to feed into group analyses.

OTHER OPTIONS
-infant         : use infant brain processing options

                  run in parallel but do not run them - the user can
                  then submit each line as a job on a compute cluster

-noappendlog    : overwrite old log files instead of appending
-cmd <file>     : default is scripts/trac-all.cmd
-no-isrunning   : do not check whether subjects are currently being processed

-umask umask    : set unix file permission mask (default 002)
-grp groupid    : check that current group is alpha groupid 
-allowcoredump  : set coredump limit to unlimited
-debug          : print out more info and generate more files
-dontrun        : do everything but execute each command
-onlyversions   : print version of each binary and exit
-version        : print version of this script and exit
-help           : print full contents of help

FOR MARTINOS CENTER CLUSTER USERS
Do not submit trac-all as a job with pbsubmit or qsub. Run it directly on the
command line. If run on a local machine, trac-all will run all analyses locally.
If run on the cluster, trac-all will submit the analysis of each subject listed
in your dmrirc file as a job.
