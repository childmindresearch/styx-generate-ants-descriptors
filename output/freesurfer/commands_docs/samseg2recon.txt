samseg2recon 7.4.1

Create and populate a subjects dir in a way that recon-all can be run
on it. This is a work in progress as it assumes that the input to samseg
is T1 and has been conformed.

For longitudinal analysis
Run samseg-long to create the samseglongdir; this will have a base
folder and time point folders called tp001, tp002, etc

Create a base subject by transfering all the base samseg analysis to the
recon-all base subject. The name of the base subject can be anything:
   samseg2recon --base --s subject_base  --samseg samseglongdir
Now run recon-all on the base
   recon-all -s subject_base -autorecon2-samseg -autorecon3

Create a subject for each time point by transfering all the samseg analysis 
from that TP to the subject for that TP. The subject name can be anything
   samseg2recon --long 2 --s long.tp002  --samseg samseglongdir
Then run
   recon-all -long-samseg subject_base long.tp002 -autorecon2-samseg -autorecon3
