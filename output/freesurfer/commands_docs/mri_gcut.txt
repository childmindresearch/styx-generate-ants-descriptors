NAME
	mri_gcut

SYNOPSIS
	mri_gcut [-110|-mult <filename>|-T <value>] in_filename out_filename

DESCRIPTION
	Skull stripping algorithm based on graph cuts.
	
	The algorithm consists of four main steps. In step 1, a conservative 
	white matter (WM) mask is estimated using region growing. In step 2, 
	the image is thresholded at the level proportional to intensity of WM,
	where the latter is estimated by averaging voxels with WM mask 
	obtained in step 1. The thresholded image will contain brain and 
	non-brain structures connected to each other by a set of (hopefully) 
	narrow connections. In step 3, an undirected graph is defined on the 
	image and subsequently partitioned into two portions using graph cuts 
	approach. In the last step, post processing is applied to regain CSF 
	and partial volume voxels that were lost during thresholding. For more
	details, see [1]
	
	When the algorithm is applied in the context of FreeSurfer pipeline, 
	eg. T1.mgz, one can choose to use voxels with intensity 110 in T1.mgz 
	as the WM mask, rather than estimating the mask from the image by 
	region growing.
	
	The memory needed to process a standard 256*256*256 .mgz file is about
	1GB ~ 1.5GB.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	in_filename
		name of the file that contains brain volume, eg. T1.mgz

	out_filename
		name given to output file, eg. brainmask.auto.mgz

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-110
		use voxels with intensity 110 as white matter mask (when 
		applied on T1.mgz, FreeSurfer only)

	-mult <filename>
		If there exists a skull-stripped volume specified by the 
		filename arg, such as that created by 'mri_watershed', the 
		skull-stripped 'in_filename' and 'filename' will be 
		intersected and the intersection stored in 'out_filename'. 
		This approach will produce cleaner skull-strip, that is less 
		likely to result in subsequent pial surface overgrowth, see 
		[1].

	-T <value>
		set threshold to value (%) of WM intensity, the value should 
		be >0 and <1; larger values would correspond to cleaner 
		skull-strip but higher chance of brain erosion. Default is set
		conservatively at 0.40, which provide approx. the same 
		negligible level of brain erosion as 'mri_watershed'.

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	None.
