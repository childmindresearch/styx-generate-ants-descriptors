gtmseg 7.4.1

Creates a segmentation that can then be used with the geometric
transfer matrix for performing PET partial volume correction. It will
create a segmentation of the head (approximate extra-cerebral CSF,
approximate skull, air cavities, and the rest of the head) using the
xcerebralseg script; this also adds segments for pons and vermis by
default; With --subseg-cblum-wm, the cerebellum WM is subsegmented
into a core component and gyri. The core components keep the
{Left,Right}-Cerebellum-White-Matter names and indices. The gyri will
become CbmWM_Gyri_{Left,Right} with indices 690 and 691.

The WM can be subsegmented into lobes with --subsegwm. Hypointensities
can be kept with --keep-hypo. The corpus callosum can be kept with
--keep-cc. If these segments are not "kept" then they are relabelled
as WM. The upsampling factor (USF) controls the resolution of the
segmentation; this make a difference for cortical
segmentations. Higher resolution is more accurate but takes up more
disk space and will require more computations later on.

Example:

gtmseg --s subject

Creates a file called $SUBJECTS_DIR/subject/mri/gtmseg.mgz without
subsegmenting WM. Hypos are re-labeled as WM as is CC. The USF is 2
(meaning .5mm voxel size).

gtmseg --s subject --keep-hypo --subsegwm --o gtmseg.wmseg.hypo.mgz --usf 1

Creates a file called $SUBJECTS_DIR/subject/mri/gtmseg.wmseg.hypo.mgz
with subsegmenting of WM and keeping yypos. CC is re-labeled as
WM. The USF is 1 (meaning 1mm voxel size).

You can use your own segmentation or a modified FS segmentation. 
It will be easiest if you modify apas+head.mgz to insert your
segmentations. apas+head.mgz is created by gtmseg but you can
create it with 

xcerebralseg --s $subject --o $SUBJECTS_DIR/$subject/mri/apas+head.mgz

To create a new segmentation by replacing voxels in apas+head.mgz with
your segmentation: make sure that the index you give your new
segmentation(s) is not already present in apas+head.mgz. Next create a
color table text file that looks something like this:

# TissueTypeSchema 
#ctTType   0  unknown                           0   0   0    0
#ctTType   1  cortex                          205  62  78    0
#ctTType   2  subcort_gm                      230 148  34    0
#ctTType   3  wm                                0 255   0    0
#ctTType   4  csf                             120  18 134    0
#ctTType   5  head                            150 150 200    0
265 MySeg            219 100 176 0 2

In the above case, it is assumed that the index that you used
was 265 and that your segmentation is for subcortical gray matter
(thus making the last number=2 in the MySeg row). If you have more
than one segmentation you are adding, then add rows into the 
color table. The first 5 entries codes for the different possible
tissue types.

You can then run

gtmseg --s subject --head apas+head+myseg.mgz \
   --ctab myseg.colortable.txt --o gtmseg+myseg.mgz  

where apas+head+myseg.mgz is apas+head.mgz with your new segmentation,
myseg.colortable.txt is the color table you created, and
gtmseg+myseg.mgz will be your output volume. Note that an output color
table gtmseg+myseg.ctab will be generated. You should check in this to
make sure that your segmentation appears. You can also run

tkmeditfv subject orig.mgz -seg gtmseg+myseg.mgz  myseg.colortable.txt
