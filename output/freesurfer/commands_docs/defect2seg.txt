defect2seg 7.4.1

Converts surface defect labels into a segmentation volume and
pointsets to make it easier to examine and evaluate.

The most simple way to run it is with --s. You can then
view it in freeview with something like

tkmeditfv $subject brain.finalsurfs.mgz -defect

This script is similar to defect-seg but does not create annotations
or sample onto fsaverage.
