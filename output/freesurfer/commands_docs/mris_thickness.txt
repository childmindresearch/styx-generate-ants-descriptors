usage: /usr/local/freesurfer/bin/mris_thickness [options] <subject name> <hemi> <thickness file>

This program measures the thickness of the cortical surface and
writes the resulting scalar field into a 'curvature' file <thickness file>.

valid options are:

-max <max>	 use <max> to threshold thickness (default=5mm)
-fill_holes <cortex label> <fsaverage cortex label> fill in thickness in holes in the cortex label

-thickness-from-seg surf label seg.mgz dmaxmm (eg, 6) ddeltamm (eg, .01) output.mgz
  This is a stand-alone option that allows thickness to be computed from a surface created around
  a segmentation by tracing a ray from one side to the other along the normal to the surface.
  The calculations are limited to the label. The output is a surface overlay with the values
  of the thickness at each vertex in the label. dmax is the maximum distance searched.
  ddelta is the step size.


-vector  compute the thickness using a variationally derived vector field instead of shortest distance
