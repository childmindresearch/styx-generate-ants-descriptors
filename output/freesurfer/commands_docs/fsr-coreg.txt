fsr-coreg : co-registers input data in prep for FreeSurfer analysis

The input folder is that as created by fsr-import, which creates a folder of modalities

For example:

fsr-import --t1w run1.T1.slice0.dicom  --t1w run2.T1.slice0.dicom --t2w T2.nii.gz \
  --mode pd myPDimage.mgz --flair FLAIR-weighted.dcm --o importdir

will import 5 volumes, two of which are T1-weighted, one is T2
weighted, one is FLAIR weighted, the other is a custom mode called "pd".

The output will be a directory structure stored in import, eg,
import/pd/r001.mgz
import/t1w/r001.mgz and r002.mgz
import/t2w/r001.mgz

When fsr-coreg is run, it registers all the with-in modality runs
together (eg, r001.mgz and r002.mgz) using mri_robust_template to
create a file called mode.native.mgz. If there is only one run, then
mode.native.mgz is a symbolic link to r001.mgz. Next, each mode is
registered (with mri_coreg) to the reference mode to create an LTA
file (mode.reg-to-ref.lta). The native volume is then resampled with
cubic interpolation into the space of the reference mode to create a
file called mode.mgz (for the reference mode, this is just a link to
mode.native.mgz). In this way, a volume is produced for each mode in
alignment with the reference mode. These can be input to samseg (which
is automatically done when running samseg with
--mode/--t1w/--t2w/--flair).

t1w, t2w, and flair are given special consideration because they
can all be used as input to recon-all.
