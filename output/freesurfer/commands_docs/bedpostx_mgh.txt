Usage: bedpostx <subject directory> [options]

expects to find bvals and bvecs in subject directory
expects to find data and nodif_brain_mask in subject directory
expects to find grad_dev in subject directory, if -g is set
options (old syntax)
-n (number of fibres per voxel, default 3)
-w (ARD weight, more weight means less secondary fibres per voxel, default 1)
-b (burnin period, default 1000)
-j (number of jumps, default 1250)
-s (sample every, default 25)
-model (Deconvolution model. 1: with sticks, 2: with sticks with a range of diffusivities (default), 3: with zeppelins)
-g (consider gradient nonlinearities, default off)


ALTERNATIVELY: you can pass on xfibres options onto directly bedpostx
 For example:  bedpostx <subject directory> --noard --cnonlinear
 Type 'xfibres --help' for a list of available options 
 Default options will be bedpostx default (see above), and not xfibres default.

Note: Use EITHER old OR new syntax.

This is a modified version of FSL's bedpostx that is compatible with
the PBS queueing system running on launchpad and can be used by MGH
Martinos Center users to parallelize computation.

This script runs the exact same algorithm as bedpostx, but it submits
the processing for each slice as a separate PBS job. Thus,
bedpostx_mgh will give you the same result as bedpostx, but do it
an order of magnitude faster.

Command line options and the structure of the input directory are the
same as for the original bedpostx.

Do not submit bedpostx_mgh as a job on launchpad. Run it directly at
the launchpad prompt and it will submit the jobs for you. Note that
this will generate a large number of jobs, so don't launch it on more
than one data set at the same time. You may get some PBS emails about
jobs being held that you have to release - you can ignore these
emails as this script will take care of that.
