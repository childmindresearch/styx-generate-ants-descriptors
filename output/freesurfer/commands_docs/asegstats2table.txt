=== Output of 'asegstats2table --help' ===

Usage: 
Converts a subcortical stats file created by recon-all and/or
mri_segstats (eg, aseg.stats) into a table in which each line is a
subject and each column is a segmentation ( there is an option to transpose that). 
The values are the volume of the segmentation in mm3 or the mean intensity over the structure.
The first row is a list of the segmentation names. The first column
is the subject name. If the measure is volume, then the estimated
intracranial volume (eTIV) is printed as the 2nd to last column 
(if present in the input), and BrainSegVol is the last column.

The subjects list can be specified in one of four ways:
  1. Specify each subject after -s 
  
          -s subject1 -s subject2 ..
  
  2. specify all subjects after --subjects.  
     --subjects does not have
     to be the last argument. Eg:
     
          --subjects subject1 subject2 ... 

  3. Specify each input file after -i 

          -i subject1/stats/aseg.stats -i subject2/stat/aseg.stats ..
  
  4. Specify all the input stat files after --inputs. --inputs does not have
     to be the last argument. Eg:
       
          --inputs subject1/stats/aseg.stats subject2/stats/aseg.stats ...

The first two methods assume the freesurfer directory structure. The
last two are general and can be used with any file produced by
mri_segstats regardless of whether it was created with recon-all or not,
however, the subject name is not printed in the file (just the row
number). Note that the first two and last two are mutually exclusive. i.e
don't specify --subjects when you are providing --inputs and vice versa.

By default, the volume (mm3) of each segmentation is reported. This
can be changed with '--meas measure', where measure can be 
volume or mean. If mean, it reports the mean intensity value from
the 6th column.

By default, all segmentations found in the input stats file are
reported. This can be changed by specifying the maximum segmentation
number with --maxsegno. This can be convenient for removing
segmentations that are always empty.

With methods 1 and 2 above uses stats/aseg.stats by default. 
This can be changed to subdir/statsfile with --subdir subdir
--statsfile statsfile.

The --common-segs flag outputs only the segmentations which are common to *all*
the statsfiles. This option is helpful if one or more statsfile contains
segmentations different from the segs of other files ( which results in the
script exiting which is the default behavior ). This option makes the
script to continue.

The --all-segs flag outputs segmentations which are the union of all
segmentations in all statsfiles. This option is helpful if one or more statsfile
contains segs different from the segs of other files ( which results in the
script exiting, the default behavior ). Subjects which don't have a certain
segmentation show a value of 0.

The --segids-from-file <file> option outputs only the segmentations present in the file.
There has to be one segmentation id per line in the file. The output table will maintain the 
order of the segmentation ids

The --segno option outputs only the segmentation id requested.
This is useful because if the number of segmentations is large,
the table becomes huge.
The order of the specified seg ids is maintained. 

The --no-segno options doesn't output the segmentations. 
This can be convenient for removing segs that are always empty.

The --transpose flag writes the transpose of the table. 
This might be a useful way to see the table when the number of subjects is
relatively less than the number of segmentations.

The --delimiter option controls what character comes between the measures
in the table. Valid options are 'tab' ( default), 'space', 'comma' and  'semicolon'.

The --skip option skips if it can't find a .stats file. Default behavior is
exit the program.

  2. specify all subjects after --subjects.  
     --subjects does not have

          --subjects subject1 subject2 ... 

  3. Specify each input file after -i 

          -i subject1/stats/aseg.stats -i subject2/stat/aseg.stats ..
  
  4. Specify all the input stat files after --inputs. --inputs does not have
     to be the last argument. Eg:
       
          --inputs subject1/stats/aseg.stats subject2/stats/aseg.stats ...

The first two methods assume the freesurfer directory structure. The
last two are general and can be used with any file produced by

the 6th column.

By default, all segmentations found in the input stats file are
reported. This can be changed by specifying the maximum segmentation
number with --maxsegno. This can be convenient for removing
segmentations that are always empty.

With methods 1 and 2 above uses stats/aseg.stats by default. 
This can be changed to subdir/statsfile with --subdir subdir
--statsfile statsfile.

The --common-segs flag outputs only the segmentations which are common to *all*
the statsfiles. This option is helpful if one or more statsfile contains
segmentations different from the segs of other files ( which results in the
script exiting which is the default behavior ). This option makes the
script to continue.

The --all-segs flag outputs segmentations which are the union of all
segmentations in all statsfiles. This option is helpful if one or more statsfile
contains segs different from the segs of other files ( which results in the
script exiting, the default behavior ). Subjects which don't have a certain
segmentation show a value of 0.

The --segids-from-file <file> option outputs only the segmentations present in the file.
There has to be one segmentation id per line in the file. The output table will maintain the 
order of the segmentation ids

The --segno option outputs only the segmentation id requested.
This is useful because if the number of segmentations is large,
the table becomes huge.
The order of the specified seg ids is maintained. 

The --no-segno options doesn't output the segmentations. 
This can be convenient for removing segs that are always empty.

The --transpose flag writes the transpose of the table. 
This might be a useful way to see the table when the number of subjects is
relatively less than the number of segmentations.

The --delimiter option controls what character comes between the measures
in the table. Valid options are 'tab' ( default), 'space', 'comma' and  'semicolon'.

The --skip option skips if it can't find a .stats file. Default behavior is
exit the program.
