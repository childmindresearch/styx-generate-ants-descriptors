xcerebralseg 7.4.1

Performs labeling of extracerebral structures including sulcal CSF,
skull/bone, head soft tissue, and air inside the head (eg, sinuses).
This is merged with the aparc+aseg.mgz segmentation to give a whole
head segmentation.  It uses a GCA (aseg+spmhead.ixi.gca) generated
from 79 subjects from the IXI database (www.brain-development.org);
see below for a demographic break down of the 79. The 79 were analyzed
using SPM New Segment, and then FreeSurfer code was used to generate
the GCA based on the SPM segmentation. It has been tested against a CT
data set and performs about as well as SPM in terms of detecting the
skull. Still, the results are far from perfect, so one should still
treat them as approximate. This segmentation is primarily intended to
be used to create nuisance variables for fMRI and PET. Note that the
"Skull" segmentation includes any kind of bone.
