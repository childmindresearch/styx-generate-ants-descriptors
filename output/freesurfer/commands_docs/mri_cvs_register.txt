NAME
	mri_cvs_register

SYNOPSIS
	Combined Volume and Surface Registration

DESCRIPTION
	This program performs subject-to-subject or subject-to-atlas volume 
	registration using the combined volumetric and surface-based (CVS) 
	registration algorithm (Postelnicu-Zollei-Fischl, TMI09). The CVS 
	registration stream consists of 3 steps: (1) surface-based 
	registration, (2) elastic registration and (3) volumetric 
	regsitration. By default, in the current implementation of the script,
	step (3) consists of two steps: (i) registration using aseg volumes 
	and (ii) registration using intensity volumes. This combination of the
	non-linear volumetric registrations proved to be very robust and 
	accurate, but the (i) step could be eliminated if quicker execution 
	time is required by using the "--noaseg" flag. Make sure that SUBJECTS
	_DIR is properly set before calling this script. 

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	None

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	--mov subjid
		FreeSurfer subject name as found in $SUBJECTS_DIR. This 
		identifies the subject that is to be moved / registered to the
		target. 

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	--template subjid
		FreeSurfer subject name as found in $SUBJECTS_DIR (or 
		--templatedir). This identifies the subject that is to be kept
		fixed (template). If this argument is missing from the 
		function call, the CVS template is used. 

	--templatedir directory
		This option needs to be used if the template subject's 
		SUBJECTS_DIR directory is different from that of the moving 
		subject. All the relevant FS recon files should be located 
		here. By default, without using this option, this parameter is
		set to be SUBJECTS_DIR. If the --template argument is not 
		specified, so the registration is to the CVS template, this 
		parameter is implicitely set. 

	--mni
		Use the CVS atlas in MNI152 space as a target for registration
		(as opposed to the default CVS template).

	--outdir directory
		Name of the output directory where all the registration 
		results are written. The default is $SUBJECTS_DIR/$subjid/cvs,
		where subjid is the subject id of the moving subject. The 
		final output directory is going to be ~.6G, but make sure that
		there is around double that amount of space available for the 
		computations.

	--asegfname fname
		Name of the segmentation volume that should be used in order 
		to guide the volumetric registration step. The default value 
		is aseg. Note that both the template and the moving subject 
		needs to have this file if you want to use this option. Also, 
		do not use the file extension of the volume that you are 
		including with this flag!

	--voltype voltype
		Changes the input from norm.mgz to voltype.mgz

	Partial run of the registration

	--step1
		Only do step 1 (spherical registration).

	--step2
		Only do step 2 (elastic registration).

	--step3
		Only do step 3 (volumetric registration).

	--noaseg
		Do not use aseg volumes in the volumetric registration 
		pipeline (default is 0). Setting this option could shorten 
		significantly the time of registration, however, might also 
		take away from the accuracy of the final results.

	--nointensity
		Do not use the intensity volumes in the volumetric 
		registration pipeline (default is 0). Setting this option 
		could shorten significantly the time of registration. It also 
		indicates that the intensity values are not to be trusted 
		during the registration.

	--hemi
		Run the CVS registration only one of the hemispheres. For 
		example, in case of single hemisphere ex-vivo cases.

	--masktargethemi
		Use this with the --hemi option when hemi is registered to 
		full brain (invivo) target. This will mask out the appropriate
		hemisphere in the target in order to avoid strange artifacts 
		resulting from registering a single hemi to a full brain. 

	--maskmovinghemi
		Use this with the --hemi option when full (invivo) brain is 
		registered to single hemi (exvivo) target. This will mask out 
		the appropriate hemisphere in the moving volume in order to 
		avoid strange artifacts resulting from registering a full 
		brain to a single hemisphere. 

	Cleanup Arguments

	--nocleanup
		Do not delete temporary files (default is 0). If this option 
		is set, make sure you have ~2G space in the output directory.

	--keepelreg
		Do not delete elastic registration (default is 0) outcome. If 
		this option is set, make sure ~1G of space is available in the
		output directory.

	--keepallm3z
		Do not delete m3z morph files that are computed during the CVS
		process (default is 0). 

	--cleanall
		Overwrite / recompute all CVS-related morphs that might have 
		been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 0).

	--cleansurfreg
		Overwrite / recompute CVS-related surface registration morphs 
		that might have been computed prior to the current CVS run 
		(default is 0).

	--cleanelreg
		Overwrite /recompute the CVS-related elastic registration 
		morph that might have been computed prior to the current CVS 
		run (default is 0).

	--cleanvolreg
		Overwrite / recompute CVS-related volumetric morphs that might
		have been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 
		0).

	Others

	--m3d
		Use m3d instead of m3z in order to represent the registration 
		morphs (and to avoid potential gzip errors).

	--openmp N
		Assign the number of nodes for openmp runs to be N. The 
		default is = 1. Note, with N = 8, you can get a threefold 
		speedup.

	--nolog
		Do not produce a log file (default is 0).

	--version
		Print version and exit.

	--help 
		Print help and exit.

	When the "--nocleanup" option is set: three more files will exist, 
	called combined*tm3d and el_reg*tm3d. These files take up a lot of 
	memory so by default are deleted. These files are

	(a)
	combined_toTEMPLATE_elreg_aseg.tm3d
		the morph that combines correspondences recovered in steps 
		(1), (2) and (3) (i)
	combined_toTEMPLATE_elreg_afteraseg-norm.tm3d
		the morph that combines correspondences recovered in steps 
		(1), (2), (3) (i) and (3) (ii)
	el_reg_toTEMPLATE.tm3d
		the elastic morph that combines correspondences recovered in 
		steps (1) and (2). This file takes up a lot of memory so, by 
		default, is deleted. It can only be recreated if the elastic 
		registration step (--step 2) is re-run.

	(b)
	combined_toTEMPLATE_elreg_norm.tm3d
		the morph that combines correspondences recovered in steps 
		(1), (2) and (3) (ii)
	el_reg_toTEMPLATE.tm3d
		the elastic morph that combines correspondences recovered in 
		steps (1) and (2). This file takes up a lot of memory so, by 
		default, is deleted. It can only be recreated if the elastic 
		registration step (--step 2) is re-run.

	If you ran the mri_cvs_registration script with the "--keepelreg" 
	option then you will also see the output morph from the elastic 
	registration step:
	el_reg_toTEMPLATE.tm3d
		the elastic morph that combines correspondences recovered in 
		steps (1) and (2). This file takes up a lot of memory so, by 
		default, is deleted. It can only be recreated if the elastic 
		registration step (--step 2) is re-run.

	The command also produces two log files. These will be created in the 
	output directory with a .log extension and contain the function calls 
	that are initiated by the registration. The one that has a *summary* 
	prefix is easier to read and does not contain all the function 
	outputs. The longer version is to be consulted if looking for more 
	details or explanations for possible errors.

EXAMPLE 1
	Register Subj1 to average CVS space: mri_cvs_register --mov Subj1ID

EXAMPLE 2
	Register Subj1 to average CVS space with outputs written into "myFav" 
	directory: mri_cvs_register --mov Subj1ID --outdir myFav/Subj1ID/cvs

EXAMPLE 3
	Register Subj1 to Subj2: mri_cvs_register --mov Subj1ID --template 
	Subj2ID

EXAMPLE 4
	Register Subj1 to Subj2 where the two subjects have different SUBJECTS
	_DIR's: mri_cvs_register --mov Subj1ID --template Subj2ID 
	--templatedir $OTHER_SUBJECTS_DIR

EXAMPLE 5
	If running mri_cvs_register on lanchpad, use "-l 
	nodes=1:ppn=5,vmem=35gb"

	Some timing estimates from launchpad with the above node settings: 
	 cvs_avg35 (default) template; launchpad: t = 33.955hrs
	 --openmp = 8; cvs_avg35 (default) template; launchpad: t = 11.28hrs
	 cvs_avg35_inMNI152 template; launchpad: t = 21.69hrs
