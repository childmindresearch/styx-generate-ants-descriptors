NAME
	mrisp_paint

SYNOPSIS
	mrisp_paint [options] <template file> <input surface> <output name>

DESCRIPTION
	This program is useful for extracting one of the arrays ("a variable")
	from a surface-registration template file. The output is a file 
	containing a surface-worth of per-vertex values, saved in "curvature" 
	format. Because the template data is sampled to a particular surface 
	mesh, this conjures the idea of "painting to a surface".
	
	Extra Notes:
	1. I (GW) am fairly certain that it only makes sense to use a sphere 
	as the input surface to which to resample the template data. At that, 
	it probably only produces a useful result to resample the data to the 
	?h.sphere.reg file of a subject that's been registered to this 
	template. (Of course, once that's done, the output curv-format file 
	can be displayed on any of the same subject's surfaces.)
	
	2. The ?h.sphere (and ?h.sphere.reg) of subject fsaverage is an 
	evenly-gridded icosahedron which would make a particularly regular 
	surface to use with mris_paint, if the objective is simply to 
	visualize a template variable. (I think). The files {fshome}/average/
	surf/?h.sphere.reg look to be the same thing, and all of these may be 
	the same thing as ic7.tri.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	<template_fname>
		Full path to template_file. Template file is usually a tif 
		file (not a picture image; tif format is just used to contain 
		FreeSurfer array data). Template may contain more than one 
		parameter, typically 3 as in the standard template. To select 
		a particular parameter, append '#' followed by frame number. 
		Eg: 'somepath/mytemplate.tif#1'. Numbering starts at 0, which 
		is the default.

	<surf_fname>
		Full path to surface file which will provide the grid 
		(vertices) onto which the template data is to be sampled or 
		'painted'. (See note below on what kind of surface is 
		suitable.)

	<out_fname>
		Output file name. Can be full path, or if directory omitted 
		then will save to same directory as surf_fname

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	None.

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-SDIR <subjects_dir>
		Set SUBJECTS_DIR. Default: use environment variable/

	-coords <which_vertices>
		Treat overlay as a surface and write it into a 3 frame 
		parameterization

	-A <navgs>
		Average curvature patterns navgs times

	-N
		Normalize curvature by variance.

	-f <frame_number>
		Paint frame number frame_number to output file. Default: 0

	-S
		Take square-root of output variable

	-variance <subject_name hemi field_no>
		Generate variance map. This selects from the template the 
		second frame of the selected parameter, and invokes some other
		computations.

	-?,-U
		Print usage

	--all-info, -all-info
		Prints BIRN-standard program information

	--help
		Prints help message

	-V <vertex_num (int)>
		Invoke diagnostics for vertex number vertex_num

	--version, -version
		Prints version information

	-W
		Write some diagnostics (DIAG_WRITE)

OUTPUTS
	<output name>
		the output specified as an argument. This is a file containing
		a surface-worth of per-vertex values, saved in "curvature" 
		format. The per-vertex values are the selected variable from 
		the template file, sampled to the given surface.
