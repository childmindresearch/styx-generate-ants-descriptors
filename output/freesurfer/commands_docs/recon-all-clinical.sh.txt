Recon-all-like stream for clinical scans of arbigrary orientation/resolution/contrast
 
Use this script to process clinical scans of arbitrary orientation, resolution, and 
contrast. It essentially runs a combination of:
* SynthSeg: to obtain an aseg.auto_noCCseg.mgz and to compute a Talairach transform
* SynthSR: not really needed for volumes / surfaces, but still nice to have a 1mm MPRAGE
* SynthSurfaces (or whatever Karthik will name it!): to fit surfaces.
 
Using this module is very simple: you just provide an input scan, the subject name, the
number of threads you want to use, and (optionally) the subjects directory:
 
   recon-all-clinical.sh INPUT_SCAN SUBJECT_ID THREADS [SUBJECT_DIR]
 
   (the argument [SUBJECT_DIR] is only necessary if the
    environment variable SUBJECTS_DIR has not been set
    or if you want to override it)
 
This stream runs a bit faster than the original recon-all, since the volumetric
segmentation is much faster than the iterative Bayesian method in the standard stream
