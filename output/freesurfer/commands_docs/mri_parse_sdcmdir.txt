This program parses the Siemens DICOM files in a given directory, and 
prints out information about each file. The output is printed to stdout
unless a file name is passed with the --o flag.

The most useful information is that which cannot be easily obtained by 
probing a dicom file. This includes: the run number, number of frames 
in the run, number of slices in the run, and, for mosaics, the number 
of rows and cols in the volume.

There are 14 columns in the output:
  1. File Number
  2. File Name 
  3. Series Number
  4. Series Error Flag (1 for error)
  5. Image Number
  6. Mosaic Flag   (1 for mosaics)
  7. Number of Rows    in the Volume
  8. Number of Columns in the Volume
  9. Number of Slices  in the Volume for the Series
 10. Number of Frames in the Series
 11. Repetition Time (sec)
 12. Echo Time (ms)
 13. Protocol Name  - white space stripped (but see BUGS)

Arguments:

  --d sdicomdir : this is the name of the directory where the 
      dicom files are located (required).

  --o outfile : this is the name of a file to which the results will be 
      printed. If unspecified, the results will be printed to stdout.

  --summarize : forces print out of information for the first file in the run.

BUGS:
Prior to 5/25/05, the protocol name was stripped of anything that
was not a number or letter. After 5/25/05 it is only stripped of
white space.
