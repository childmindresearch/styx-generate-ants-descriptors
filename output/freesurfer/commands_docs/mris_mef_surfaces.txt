usage: /usr/local/freesurfer/bin/mris_mef_surfaces [options] <subject name> <hemisphere>

This program positions the tessellation of the cortical surface
at the white matter surface, then the gray matter surface
and generate surface files for these surfaces as well as a
'curvature' file for the cortical thickness, and a surface file
which approximates layer IV of the cortical sheet.

valid options are:

-q    omit self-intersection and only generate gray/white surface.
-c    create curvature and area files from white matter surface
-a <avgs>   average curvature values <avgs> times (default=10)
-whiteonly  only generate white matter surface
