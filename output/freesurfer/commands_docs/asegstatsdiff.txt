USAGE: asegstatsdiff <subj1> <subj2> [<outdir>]

The utility asegstats2table is executed given the two subjects
as input, and an output table called asegstats.txt is produced.
Then, another row is added to that table containing the percent
difference between the data of each of the two subjects.
Mainly this is used to evaluate the effect of a code change on
the aseg morphometry data for a given subject (before and after).
The return code is the number of structures found to have nonzero
percentage differences.

[<outdir>] - optionally specify a directory to write asegstats.txt
