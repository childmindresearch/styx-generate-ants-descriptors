7.4.1

This program assigns each vertex on a cortical surface to a cluster 
based on the distribution of intensity values in the source file. 
A vertex must meet two criteria to be part of a cluster. First, 
its intensity must fall within a certain range (the intensity threshold 
criteria). Second, it must be part of a contiguous set of vertices 
that meet the threshold criteria and whose surface area is greater  
than a minimum.  

There are three types of output. (1) Summary file - simple text file
with a list of clusters found including maximum value, area, and 
talairach coordinate. (2) Filtered - identical to the input except that
vertices not assigned to a cluster are set to 0. (3) Cluster number
surface - this has the same format as the input and filtered output
except that the value at each vertex is the cluster number assigned
to it. 

COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
--in inputfile 

This is the input data to the clustering program.
Reads all formats supported by mri_convert.

--subject subjectid

Surface values are defined on this subject.

--hemi hemi

Specify the cortical hemisphere that the input represents. Valid values
are lh and rh.

--surf surface

This is the surface to use when computing the talairach coordinagtes.
Default is white.

--annot annotationname

Report the cortical annotation that the maximum in each label falls into. 
The annotation used will be SUBJECTS_DIR/subject/label/hemi.annotationname.annot.
Eg, --annot aparc

--frame frameno

Zero-based frame number of the input file. Default is 0. For paint
format, zero is the only possible value.

--thmin minthresh

Minimum threshold in the intensity threshold criteria. See 
SETTING THE CLUSTER INTENSITY THRESHOLD CRITERIA below.

--thmax maxthresh

Maximum threshold in the intensity threshold criteria. If negative,
then the maximum threshold is infinity. See SETTING THE CLUSTER 
INTENSITY THRESHOLD CRITERIA below.

--sign threshold sign

This is used to control the sign of the threshold criteria. Legal
values are pos, neg, and abs. See SETTING THE CLUSTER INTENSITY 
THRESHOLD CRITERIA below.

--no-adjust  

Do not adjust thresh for one-tailed tests. By default, the threshold
will be adjusted when the --sign is pos or neg by subtracting log10(2.0).
This assumes several things: (1) the source is a -log10(p) map, and (2)
the pvalue was computed using a two-sided t-test. Under these conditions,
subtracting log10(2.0) is like dividing the p-value by 2 (ie, changing it
from a two-tailed test to a one-tailed test). If the input map does not
meet these criteria, then run with --no-adjust.

--fdr FDR

Set thmin with False Discovery Rate. 0 < FDR < 1. Usually something 
like .01 or .05. Only when input is -log10(p).

--csd csdfile <--csd csdfile>

Load one or more CSD files. CSD stands for 'Cluster Simulation Data'. This
file is produced by running mri_glmfit with --sim. The the threshold and hemi
info are obtained from the CSD file and cannot be specified on the command-
line. If more than one CSD is specified, they are merged into one CSD internally.
When a CSD file is specified, three more columns are added to the summary table:
  1. CWP - cluster-wise pvalue. The pvalue of the cluster corrected for 
     multiple comparisons
  2. CWPLow - lower 90% confidence limit of CWP based on binomial distribution
  3. CWPHi  - upper 90% confidence limit of CWP based on binomial distribution
In addition, the user can specify --cwsig, which saves the sigificance map of 
the clusters in which the value of each vertex is the -log10(pvalue) of cluster
to which the vertex belongs (the cluster-wise significance). The user can also
specify that the vertex-wise significance be computed and saved  with --vwsig.
The significance is based on the distribution of the maximum significances 
found during the CSD simulation.

--csdpdf csdpdfile

Compute PDF/CDF of CSD data and save in csdpdffile. This is mostly good for debugging.

--csdpdf-only

Only write the csd pdf file.

--minarea area

Minimum surface area (in mm^2) that a set of contiguous vertices
must achieve in order to be considered a cluster.

--clabel labelfile

Constrain cluster search to be inside or outside clabel. By default,
it will be constrained to be INSIDE. For OUTSIDE, specify --clabelinv.
clabel must be a surface-based label.

--mask-inv 

Constrain cluster search to be OUTSIDE mask or clabel. 

--sum summaryfile

Text file in which to store the cluster summary. See SUMMARY FILE
OUTPUT below.

--o outputid 

File in which to store the surface values after setting the
non-cluster vertices to zero. Fmt is the format (currently, only
paint format is supported). Note: make sure to put a ./ in front
of outputid or else it will attempt to write the output to the
subject's surf directory.

--ocn ocnid 

File in which to store the cluster number of each vertex. This can be
useful for determining to which cluster a particular vertex
belongs. It can be viewed as with any other surface value file. Fmt is
the format (currently, only paint format is supported). Note: make
sure to put a ./ in front of outputid or else it will attempt to write
the output to the subject's surf directory.

--olab outlabelbase

Save output clusters as labels. There will be a label file for each
cluster. The name will be outlabelbase-XXXX.label, where XXXX is the
4-digit, zero-paded cluster number. The stat field in the label will
be the value of the input statistic at that vertex.

--xfm xfmfile

This is a transform file that is used to compute the Talairach 
coordinates of a vertex for the summary file. The file must be
found in subjects_dir/subjectid/transforms. The default is
talairach.xfm which is based on the MNI atlas (see --fixmni).

--fixmni --nofixmni

Fix (or do not fix) MNI Talairach coordinates based on Matthew Brett's
transform. See http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/mnispace.html.
Default is to fix. The user may elect not to fix if the xfm file
is not talairach.xfm (see --xfm).

--sd subjects_dir

This allows the user to change the FreeSurfer subjects's directory
from the command-line. If unspecified, it will be set to the 
environment variable SUBJECTS_DIR

SETTING THE CLUSTER INTENSITY THRESHOLD CRITERIA

Vertices on the surface are excluded or included, in part, based on
their intensity. For a vertex to be included, its value (ie,
intensity) must be within a certain range (namely, between the minimum
threshold, set with --thmin, and the maximum threshold, set with
--thmax). While thmin and thmax must be positive values, the sign of
the threshold can be set with --thsign. However, if thmax is negative,
then the maximum threshold will be set to infinity. For example, if
--thmin 2 --thmax 5 --thsign pos, then all vertices with values
between (positive) 2 and 5 will be candidates for clustering. However,
if --thsign abs is used instead, then all vertices between -2 and -5
as well as between +2 and +5 will be candidates.

SUMMARY FILE OUTPUT

The summary file (the argument of the --sum flag) will contain a 
summary of the result of the clustering as well as a summary of the
conditions under which the clustering was performed. It will list
the clusters (1 to N) along with the maximum value found in the
cluster (Max), the vertex at which this maximum value was found
(VtxMax), the surface area of the cluster (Size), and the Talaiarach
coordinates of the maximum (based on talairach.xfm). A sample 
summary file is shown below.
