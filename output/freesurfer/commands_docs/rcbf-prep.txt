rcbf-prep

 --o outdir
 --rcbf rcbfvol
 --s subject (or use --reg)

 --roitab ROITable (like FreeSurferColorLUT.txt)
 --reg register.dat (instead of subject)
 --t template (instead of using rcbf itself)

rcbf-prep 7.4.1

Performs intergration of rCBF as produced by Siemens scanners (usually
the ep2d_pasl sequence) with FreeSurfer analysis in preparation for
group analysis. It creates an output directory (--o), registers the
rCBF (--rcbf) to the FreeSurfer anatomical for the subject
(--subject), resamples to both hemispheres (?h.rcbf.mgh) and to MNI305
(rcbf.mni305.nii) and creates a stats file (roi.dat). These can
be merged with rcbf-merge in preparation for group analysis.
The results will be in mL/100g/min.

See surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/RcbfProc for more info.

Other options:

--roitab roi-table

This is the table which specfies which the ROIs will be summarized. By
default, $FREESURFER_HOME/FreeSurferColorLUT.txt is used. This has a
lot of ROIs. If you do not want all of them then make a copy and
delete the ones that you do not want and pass as --roitab.
