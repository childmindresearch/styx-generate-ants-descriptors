Measures the anatomical SNR in white matter (WM). This can be used as
a quality assurance (QA) metric. This metric is experimental and may 
change in the future.

Simply run:  wm-anat-snr --s subject

The WM is determined from the aparc+aseg.mgz automatic segmentation as
voxels with the following indices: 2 41 7 46 251 252 253 254 255 77 78
79. The last three are WM hypointensities.  A mask is made from these
voxels and then eroded by 3 voxels (controlled by --nerode). The mean
and standard deviation (measured over space) of the norm.mgz is
computed within this mask.  The snr is then computed as the
mean/stddev. The output is put in stats/wmsnr.e3.dat (e3 is for erode
by 3, so the name will change if you change the number of erodes). The
output file contains 6 columns:

1. subject name
2. SNR
3. Mean WM intensity
4. Standard deviation of WM intensity
5. Number of voxels in the mask after erosion
6. Number of erodes

Typical values are 15-20. Subjects with less than 15 should be
scrutinized. SNR values may be low because of several factors,
including motion, imperfect intensity inhomogeneity correction, high
background noise, some scanner artifact, a failure in the FreeSurfer
analysis, or some other reason. It might also be low because the
subject biologically has a large range of intensities (eg, many
hypointensities).  Note that a low SNR does not necessarily mean that
the data are bad, and a high SNR does not necessarily mean that
everything is ok.

By default, this program will not re-run an analysis unless the
output file is older than the aparc+aseg.mgz or the norm.mgz. To
force re-analysis, run with --force.

After running on a group of subjects, you can run

cd $SUBJECTS_DIR
cat */stats/wmsnr.e3.dat | sort -k 2 -n 

To get a list of subjects sorted by the SNR.
