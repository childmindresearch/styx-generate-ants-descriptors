usage: /usr/local/freesurfer/bin/mri_nlfilter [options] <input image file> <output image file>

This program will process the image contained in <input image file>
using a nonlocal filter, and write the results to <output image file>.

The default filter is the median, but either Gaussian or mean filtering
can be specified through command line options (see below).

By default the image is smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (sigma=0.500)
before the offset field is calculated. This can be modified using
the -blur command line option.

The input and output image formats are specified by the file name extensions.
Supported formats are:

   HIPS   (.hipl or .hips)
   MATLAB (.mat)
   TIFF   (.tif or .tiff).

Note that 8-bit output images, which are generated if the input
image is 8-bit, are scaled to be in the range 0-255.

valid options are:

  -blur <sigma>     - specify sigma of blurring kernel (default=0.500).
  -gaussian <sigma> - filter with Gaussian instead of median.
  -mean             - filter with mean instead of median.
  -w <window size>  - specify window used for offset calculation (default=3).
  --version         - display version #.
  --help            - display this help message.

  use --help to get help
  -cplov    - filter with cplov (whatever that is).
  -minmax   - filter with minmax (whatever that is)
  -n        - don't use offsets (just apply standard filters)
  -nc       - don't crop to >0 region of image
