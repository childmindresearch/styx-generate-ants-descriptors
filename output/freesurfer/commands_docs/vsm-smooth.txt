vsm-smooth 7.4.1

Implements a masked smoothing in which the input (vsm) is unchanged in
voxels that have a non-zero value. In voxels with a zero value, the
value is replaced with vsm smoothed by the given amount. This will
likely only change the voxels that are near the edge of the non-zero
voxels. This is a simple way to extrapolate the non-zero voxels beyond
their range. This works well for a B0 distortion correction voxel
shift map (vsm), but it can be applied to other maps.
