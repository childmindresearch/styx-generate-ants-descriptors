gcatrain 7.4.1

gcatrain builds a GCA from a group of manually labeled subjects.
It is meant to replace rebuild_gca_atlas.csh.

Example - build gca from all the subjects listed in subjestlist.txt
using 990104_vc700 as the initialization subject. Use the file
called talairach_man.xfm in 990104_vc700/mri/transforms as the
initial registration. Use seg_edited10.mgz as the manually defined
segmentation. Two iterations will be performed (the first being the
simple creation of the GCA from the initial subject). Four threads
will be used. The output will go into a folder called rb10-gcatrain

gcatrain --f subjectlist.txt --init 990104_vc700 talairach_man.xfm 
  --seg seg_edited10.mgz --niters 2 --g rb10-gcatrain --nthreads 4 

This script creates a new SUBJECTS_DIR tree in rb10-gcatrain.  For
each subject, the "prepone" script is run. This copies the raw data
from each subjects mri/orig folder to the subjects dir in the output
folder and runs recon-all far enough to create the nu.mgz. It also
copies the manual segmentations and the xfm for the init subject.
Once this is done, the source data are no longer used. 

It then runs "grcainit" on the initial subject. This run
mri_ca_normalize on the init subject and builds the first gca (stored
in outdir/gca/gca.i01.gca).

It then loops through all subjects pbsubmitting recon-all to perform
mri_em_register, mri_ca_normalize, and mri_ca_register to gca.i01.gca
(outputs are coded with i02). When all subjects are finished for this
loop, then mri_ca_train is run to create gca.i02.gca. If more than two
iterations were specified, then the above loop is repeated.

If you want to perform more iterations, run gcatrain like this

gcatrain --niters 3 --g rb10-gcatrain --nthreads 4 

It will see that the first two iterations have already been performed
and will proceed with the third iteration.

Future modifications may be to allow for more than one init subject.

To perform jackknife testing, see jkgcatrain.
