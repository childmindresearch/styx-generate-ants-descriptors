  --ntp ntp : number of time points (ie, number of TRs)
  --TR TRsec : TR in seconds
  --cutoff fCutOffHz : cutoff frequency in Hz

polyorder 7.4.1

Computes the order of polynomial regressors needed to achieve a
highpass filter with the given cutoff frequency. This can then be
entered into mkanalysis-sess with the --polyfit option. Note that the
value here depends on the number of time points and the TR.  If these
change from run to run, then the order of the polynomials will need to
change.

Example:

polyorder --ntp 100 --TR 2 --cutoff 0.05
28
