feat2surf 7.4.1

Resamples Feat statistics onto the surface of the subject and onto a
stereo-taxic surface atlas.

Statistics are obtained from FeatDir/stats as well as those volumes in
FeatDir beginning with "cluster" and "rendered". The results are
stored in FeatDir/reg_surf-lh-SUBJECT/stats, and
FeatDir/reg_surf-rh-SUBJECT/stats where SUBJECT is the freesurfer name
of the subject. It will also resample to the common space and stored
the results in in FeatDir/reg_surf-lh-targid/stats and
FeatDir/reg_surf-rh-targid/stats, where targid is the subject that
defines the common surface space (default is fsaverage). If you are using
the "new" FreeSurfer recon where you have registered your surfaces
to the "filled" atlas, then use fsaverage instead.

Works properly on ANALYZE or NIFTI; output is stored in mgz format.

Creates log file featdir/reg/freesurfer/feat2surf.log

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

--feat featdir <--feat featdir ...>

Directory where Feat results are stored. Can specify multiple --feat.

--featdirfile file <--featdirfile file>

File with a list of Feat directories. Both --feat and --featdirfile
can be specified (multiple times).

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

--projfrac fraction

Sample functional a fraction of the cortical thickness normal to the
surface. Eg, --projfrac 0.5 will sample in the middle of the cortical
ribbon. Default is 0.  The subject must have thickness files in the
surf directory.

--hemi hemi

Run on hemi (lh or rh) only. Default is to do both.

--target subject

Subject used to define common surface space (default is fsaverage).

--surf surface

Surface to resample to (default is white).

EXAMPLE

# Assume a data set exists called fbert.img
# Analyze fbert.img with Feat to generate directory fbert.feat

# Register fbert.feat to subject bert:
reg-feat2anat --feat fbert.feat --subject bert

# Resample fbert.feat onto the surface
feat2surf --feat fbert.feat

# View on native surface
tksurfer bert lh inflated \
  -overlay fbert.feat/reg_surf-lh-bert/stats/zstat1.nii.gz

# View on common surface
tksurfer fsaverage lh inflated \
  -overlay fbert.feat/reg_surf-lh-fsaverage/stats/zstat1.nii.gz


BUGS

The surface-based data are stored in "volume" formats (ie, the format
found in the FEAT dir).  In this case, the spatial dimensions do not
correspond to volume dimensions but rather the number of vertices on
the surface. This is typically on the order of 150,000. Ideally, we
would simply store the surface data as a "volume" with 150,000
columns, 1 row, and 1 slice.  However, ANALYZE cannot represent
dimensions over 2^15, or 32768.  Same problem with NIFTI. To get
around this, we factor the number of vertices into dimensions smaller
than 32768. Eg, the fsaverage surface has 163842 vertices which we
factor into 1974x83. However, for individuals there is no guarantee
that the number of vertices will have a factor less than 32768. For
this reason the data resampled on the individual surfaces is stored in
MGH format (which does not have these restrictions).
