7.4.1

mris_thickness_diff computes the difference of two surface data
sets defined on the two surface mesh. Result = data2 - data1
(in the sense of closest vertex).

mris_thickness_diff uses closest Euclidean distance to 
define correspondence across the two surfaces. It does 
not assume that the correspondence is given by the vertex IDs.
But if one has two surfaces that are the 'same' but not aligned 
in space yet, the trick is to just use one of them as both the 
src and trgt surface, and mris_thickness_diff will then associate 
data by their corresponding vertex ID. 

In contrast, mri_sur2surf builds the surface correspondence 
through the spherical map. This 'nonlinear' way of building
surface correspondence is less reliable than using linear 
registration and building correspondence by surface distance 
in the longitudinal case. Overall, the key is that mri_surf2surf 
is better to align surfaces across different subjects while ICP 
or linear volume registration is better for aligning surfaces 
from the same subject across time.  This means that 
mris_thickness_diff is more useful for longitudinal studies.

The -register flag to mris_thickness_diff will run ICP internally 
to align the two input surfaces if they have not been aligned yet. 
But ICP (iterative-closest-point) has its limited capture range. 
For example, if one surface is the other one rotated by more than 
90 degree, ICP may not align them.
