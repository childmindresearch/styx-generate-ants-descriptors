USAGE: aparcstatsdiff <subj1> <subj2> <hemi> <parc> <meas> [<outdir>]

The utility aparcstats2table is executed given the two subjects
as input, along with hemisphere (rh or lh), parcellation scheme
(aparc or aparc.a2009s) and measure (area, volume, or thickness), 
and an output table called aparcstats-hemi.parc.meas.txt 
is produced.
Then, another row is added to that table containing the percent
difference between the data of each of the two subjects.
Mainly this is used to evaluate the effect of a code change on
the aparc morphometry data for a given subject (before and after).
The return code is the number of structures found to have nonzero
percentage differences.
