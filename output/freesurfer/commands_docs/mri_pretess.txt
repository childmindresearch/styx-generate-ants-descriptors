NAME
	mri_pretess

SYNOPSIS
	mri_pretess [options] filledvol labelstring normvol newfilledvol

DESCRIPTION
	Changes white matter (WM) segmentation so that the neighbors of all 
	voxels labeled as WM have a face in common - no edges or corners 
	allowed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	filledvol
		usually wm.mgz

	labelstring
		usually wm

	normvol
		usually norm.mgz

	newfilledvol
		usually wm.mgz

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	-debug_voxel C R S

	-nocorners
		no removal of corner configurations in addition to edge ones

	-w
		turn on diagnostic writing

	-keep
		keep WM edits

	-test
		adds a voxel that should be removed by mri_pretess. The value 
		of the voxel is set to that of an ON-edited WM, so it should 
		be kept with -keep. The output will NOT be saved.
