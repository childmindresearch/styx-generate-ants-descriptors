dcmunpack 7.4.1

Sorts and converts a directory of DICOM files (Siemens, GE, Philips)
into an output hierarchy with nifti (nii), mgh, mgz, or analyze output
formats (will not create a series of 3D SPM files). This will
recursively search through all the subdirectories of the source
directory. To a large extent, this replaces unpacksdcmdir (the
Siemens-only unpacker) and will take most of its command-line
arguments. This program can often take a long time to run and usually
has to be run twice, once to get the list of runs and second to
specify which runs to unpack. There are two ways to make it run
faster.  First, use -auto-runseq (see below) which will unpack all
runs. Alternatively, when you run it the first time to get a list of
runs, add -index-out index.dat. Then when you run it a second time,
use -index-in index.dat to make it run much faster.

-src dcmdir <-src dcmdir>

Dicom source directory. You can specify more than one. If you just specify
a source directory, it will give a summary of what it finds (like -scanonly 
did for unpacksdcmdir). You should still give it -one-per-dir or -martinos
if applicable.

-targ targetdir

Output directory. Do not need to include when just getting information
about what is in the directory.

-run run subdir format stemname <<nskip> ndrop>

Specify unpacking rules for a given run (series), subdir is the
subdirectory under the target dir, format is the format extension
(nii, mgh, mgz, img), stemname is the base file name, nskip is the
number of time points to skip (optional, good for some fMRI), and
ndrop is the number of time points to drop from the end. The output
file will be targetdir/subdir/RRR/fname.format if using the FSFAST
output hierarchy (the default) or targetdir/subdir/fname.format with
-generic, where RRR is the 3-digit, zero-padded run number. Eg, "-run
3 bold nii f" would become targetdir/bold/003/f.nii in fsfast or
targetdir/bold/f.nii in generic. If the stemname has an extension,
that extension is ignored.

-auto-runseq format 

Save all scans in the targetdir as runo.seqname.format. Eg,
-auto-runseq nii.gz would save files with names like
0002.mprage.nii.gz, 0003.ge_functionals.nii.gz, etc. This can be
easier than using the -run because you do not have to specify all the
runs on the command line and you only need to run this dcmunpack
once. It will exclude any sequneces named Localizer, localizer,
AAHScout, AHScout_sag, AAHScout_cor, AAHScout_tra, AAScout. 
If you want to skip a run, then add -run-skip runno. If there are
errors in the conversion, then, by default, dcmunpack will exit with
error. If you want to convert all you can and deal with the errors  
later, then add -no-exit-on-error.

-one-per-dir

Assume that the source directory (or subdirectory) contains only one
series.  This is usually the case for GE, and this can speed things up
tremendously.

-martinos
-mgh
-bourget

Assume that the DICOM file names have the form produced at the MGH
Martinos Center when you "push something to bourget" from the scanner,
namely that each series will have one file that ends in "1.dcm", eg
397000-000007-000001.dcm.  This can speed things up considerably.
Note: as of August, 2012, the naming convention that allows for fast
unpacking does not exist. 

If you have to run this twice, it will be faster if you run it with
--index-out index.dat when you are getting a list of runs, then run it
again with --index-in index.dat when you go to unpack it.

-no-infodump

Do not create the fname-infodump.dat file

-generic

Do not use FSFAST hierarchy.

-no-convert

Do not actually run mri_convert

-copy-only

Only copy dicom files to output directory (implies -no-convert)

# CD into the dicom directory

RELATIONSHIP TO UNPACKSDCMDIR

unpacksdcmdir is the Siemens-only unpacker. dcmunpack will take the
same command-line arguments except: -cfg, -seqcfg, -nspmzeropad,
-no-unpackerr (it unpacks everything), and -scanonly (you can still
get a scanonly-like summary of the data). dcmunpack does not accept
SPM as an output format. The seq.info file is not created (it is not
needed for newer versions of FSFAST).  These features can be
programmed, I just have not gotten around to it. Unlike unpacksdcmdir,
dcmunpack searches subdirectories and can unpack GE data.
