Usage: 
Converts a cortical stats file created by recon-all and or
mris_anatomical_stats (eg, ?h.aparc.stats) into a table in which
each line is a subject and each column is a parcellation. By
default, the values are the area of the parcellation in mm2. The
first row is a list of the parcellation names. The first column is
the subject name. If the measure is thickness then the last column
is the mean cortical thickness.

The subjects list can be specified on either of two ways:
  1. Specify each subject after a -s flag 

            -s subject1 -s subject2 ... --hemi lh
  
  2. Specify all subjects after --subjects flag. --subjects does not have
     to be the last argument. Eg:

            --subjects subject1 subject2 ... --hemi lh

By default, it looks for the ?h.aparc.stats file based on the
Killiany/Desikan parcellation atlas. This can be changed with
'--parc parcellation' where parcellation is the parcellation to
use. An alternative is aparc.a2009s which was developed by
Christophe Destrieux. If this file is not found, it will exit
with an error unless --skip in which case it skips this subject
and moves on to the next.

By default, the area (mm2) of each parcellation is reported. This can
be changed with '--meas measure', where measure can be area, volume
(ie, volume of gray matter), thickness, thicknessstd, or meancurv.
thicknessstd is the standard dev of thickness across space.

Example:
 aparcstats2table --hemi lh --subjects 004 008 --parc aparc.a2009s 
    --meas meancurv -t lh.a2009s.meancurv.txt

lh.a2009s.meancurv.txt will have 3 rows: (1) 'header' with the name
of each structure, (2) mean curvature for each structure for subject

The --common-parcs flag writes only the ROIs which are common to all 
the subjects. Default behavior is it puts 0.0 in the measure of an ROI
which is not present in a subject. 

The --parcs-from-file <file> outputs only the parcs specified in the file
The order of the parcs in the file is maintained. Specify one parcellation
per line.

The --report-rois flag, for each subject, gives what ROIs that are present
in atleast one other subject is absent in current subject and also gives 
what ROIs are unique to the current subject.

The --transpose flag writes the transpose of the table. 
This might be a useful way to see the table when the number of subjects is
relatively less than the number of ROIs.

The --delimiter option controls what character comes between the measures
in the table. Valid options are 'tab' ( default), 'space', 'comma' and
'semicolon'.

The --skip option skips if it can't find a .stats file. Default behavior is
exit the program.

The --parcid-only flag writes only the ROIs name in the 1st row 1st column
of the table. Default is hemi_ROI_measure
