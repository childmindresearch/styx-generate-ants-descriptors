USAGE: dicom-rename

Copies dicom file(s) to new path with more meaningful names

 --o outbase

   --version    : print version and exit
   --help       : print help and exit


Renames (actually copies) input dicom files to a new name that
takes the form outbase-SSS-IIIII.dcm. The output can be used
with dcmdir-info-mgh.

Example:

dicom-rename dicomdir/* --o mydicoms/bert

This will find all the dicoms in dicomdir/*, and rename them to
mydicoms/bert-SSS-IIIII.dcm, where SSS is the series number (dicom tag
20,11) and IIIII is the image number (dicom tag 20,13). The series
number and image number are padded with zeros to make them 3 or 5
digits long. Note: does not actually rename the dicom file; it just
copies it to a new name (ie, it will not delete the input file(s)).

It is ok if input files are not dicom. The script will only use the
files in the list that are dicom.

This script is especially useful when copying data from a Siemens CD
where the file names are often uninterpretable.
