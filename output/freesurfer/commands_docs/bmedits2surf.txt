bmedits2surf 7.4.1

This program computes a binary map of surface locations near where the
brainmask.mgz has been edited. It creates two files for each hemisphere,
one for each type of edit. These will be

subject/surf/lh.bmerase.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/rh.bmerase.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/lh.bmclone.fsa.mgh
subject/surf/rh.bmclone.fsa.mgh

These are binary masks on fsaverage space. They can be concatenated
together to make maps of the likelyhood that a given spatial location
is affected by a brainmask edit. Currently, this will not include
changes to brainmask.finalsurfs.mgz.

It will also create 
  subject/stats/bmclone.dat
  subject/stats/bmerase.dat
The first number will be the number of voxels cloned/edited
