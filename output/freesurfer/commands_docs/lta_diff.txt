NAME
	lta_diff

SYNOPSIS
	lta_diff trans1.lta [trans2.lta] [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
	This program can compute different distance norms for a single 
	transform or for the difference between two transforms.
	If only a single transform is passed, it is compared to identity.  
	 

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	The two transform files are positional arguments, the second one is 
	optional.

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	--dist <int> 
		the following distance types are supported:
		 1    Rigid Trans. Dist. (||log(R)|| + ||T||) on D=M2*M1^(-1)
		 2 *  Affine Transform Distance (RMS) on D=M2-M1 (r=100mm)
		 3    8-corners mean distance after transform 
		 4    Max Displacement on Sphere 
		 5    Determinant (scaling) on D = M1*M2
		 6    Interpolation Smoothing (only for first transform)
		 7    Decomposition of D= M1*M2 = Rot*Shear*Scaling
		(* default is 2)
		The Affine Trans. Dist. (RMS) is based on Jenkinson 99 RMS 
		deviation tech report.

	--invert1 
		invert first transform before computing difference matrix D

	--invert2 
		invert second transform before computing difference matrix D

	--vox 
		compute distance in vox coordinates (after adjusting for vox 
		sizes). Default: work in RAS coordinates.

	--normdiv <float> 
		divide final distance by this (e.g. for step adjustment, this 
		is usually not necessary)

	--radius <float> 
		in mm, use for RMS (dist 2), default 100 to include head

REPORTING
	Report bugs to <freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu>

SEE ALSO
	mri_robust_register (to construct registrations between images)




ERROR: Please specify a transform file first !
