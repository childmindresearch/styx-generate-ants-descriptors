NAME
	mri_aparc2aseg

SYNOPSIS
	mri_aparc2aseg [options]

DESCRIPTION
	Maps the cortical labels from the automatic cortical parcellation 
	(aparc) to the automatic segmentation volume (aseg). The result can be
	used as the aseg would. The algorithm is to find each aseg voxel 
	labeled as cortex (3 and 42) and assign it the label of the closest 
	cortical vertex. If the voxel is not in the ribbon (as defined by mri/
	lh.ribbon and rh.ribbon), then the voxel is marked as unknown (0). 
	This can be turned off with --noribbon. The cortical parcellation is 
	obtained from subject/label/hemi.aparc.annot which should be based on 
	the curvature.buckner40.filled.desikan_killiany.gcs atlas. The aseg is
	obtained from subject/mri/aseg.mgz and should be based on the RB40_
	talairach_2005-07-20.gca atlas. If these atlases are used, then the 
	segmentations can be viewed with tkmedit and the 
	FreeSurferColorLUT.txt color table found in $FREESURFER_HOME. These 
	are the default atlases used by recon-all.
	
	Note: The volumes of the cortical labels will be different than 
	reported by mris_anatomical_stats because partial volume information 
	is lost when mapping the surface to the volume. The values reported by
	mris_anatomical_stats will be more accurate than the volumes from the 
	aparc+aseg volume.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
	None.

REQUIRED FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	None.

OPTIONAL FLAGGED ARGUMENTS
	--s subject
		Name of the subject as found in the SUBJECTS_DIR.

	--o volfile
		Full path of file to save the output segmentation in. Default 
		is mri/aparc+aseg.mgz

	--old-ribbon
		use mri/hemi.ribbon.mgz as a mask for the cortex

	--new-ribbon
		Mask cortical voxels with mri/ribbon.mgz. Same as --volmask

	--a2005s
		Use ?h.aparc.a2005s.annot. Output will be 
		aparc.a2005s+aseg.mgz. Creates index numbers that match a2005s
		entries in FreeSurferColorsLUT.txt

	--a2009s
		Use ?h.aparc.a2009s.annot. Output will be 
		aparc.a2009s+aseg.mgz. Creates index numbers that match a2009s
		entries in FreeSurferColorsLUT.txt

	--annot annotname
		Use annotname surface annotation. By default, uses 
		?h.aparc.annot. With this option, it will load 
		?h.annotname.annot. The output file will be set to 
		annotname+aseg.mgz, but this can be changed with --o. Note: 
		running --annot aparc.a2009s is NOT the same as running 
		--a2009s. The index numbers will be different.

	--annot-table annottable
		default is $FREESURFER_HOME/Simple_surface_labels2009.txt

	--base-offset offset
		Add offset to all segmentation ids. Put as last argument.

	--labelwm
		For each voxel labeled as white matter in the aseg, re-assign 
		its label to be that of the closest cortical point if its 
		distance is less than dmaxctx. The default value of dmaxctx is
		5mm, but this can be changed with --wmparc-dmax. If it is 
		beyond this distance, then it is labeld as 'Unsegmented White 
		Matter'.

	--wmparc-dmax dmax
		max dist (mm) from cortex to be labeld as gyral WM (5mm)

	--rip-unknown
		do not label WM based on 'unknown' corical label

	--hypo-as-wm
		label hypointensities as WM

	--no-fix-parahip
		do not remove unconnected regions from WM parahip

	--help
		print out information on how to use this program

	--version
		print out version and exit

	--smooth_normals niters
		Change default (10) number of surface normal smoothing steps. 
		This is used to prevent speckling of inaccurate voxels due 
		(e.g.) the closest pial vertex being on the opposite bank of a
		sulcus.

	--crs-test c r s
		test mapping of col row slice

	--lh, --rh
		only process the given hemisphere

	--threads nthreads
		Run in parallel with nthreads

OUTPUTS
	volume1
		segmentation volume
