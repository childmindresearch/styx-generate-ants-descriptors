fscalc.fsl - a freesurfer wrapper around fslmaths

This is a utility that extends fslmaths so that any format that can
be read/written by freesurfer can be used. It operates in the same
way as fslmaths, just use the same command line flags and arguments
with the exception that the input file formats can be anything that
freesurfer reads, and the output file format can be anything that
freesurfer writes. Forces output data type to be float.

This can work on some surfaces if the number of vertices is not
prime. More specficially, the largest prime factor of the number
of vertices cannot be greater than 2^15.

To use it in this way, add --surf subject hemi. This will
run mri_surf2surf to reshape the data into a dimension that can
fit into nifti.

By default, surfaces are reshaped to try to fit inside of nifti,
and the ouput is also reshaped. To convert back to 1d spatial dims,
add --reshape1d.

See fslmaths for more info.
